\chapter{The Plague Ghost Hides Her Power (3)}

A dark cloud hung over the peaceful land of Jianping.

Horrific, indescribable evil deeds, cruelly trampling even the basics that people should naturally enjoy, continued to unfold.

Look now.

Clink. The sound of ceramic dishes clashing.

In the silent, breathless stillness, the trivial sound of dishes clashing seemed to thunder.

The family seated around the table froze as one, unable to even breathe.

A truly suffocating silence!

The family, rigid with fear, anxiously rolled their eyes, looking for cues.

And after a long while—

"I don't think it's okay."

Then, shhh! A whispered breath through teeth, followed by a voice so low it was like the wind.

'Lower your voice. Don't make a sound.'

And then, once again, a silence as heavy as a thousand pounds!

What on earth was this horrifying situation!

In Qing's homeland, they say even dogs aren't disturbed when eating, and in Zhongyuan, they say that eating was more important than the Emperor\footnote{吃饭皇帝大; Chifan Huangdi Da}.

Moreover, humans were creatures who must eat to live, so this mealtime should naturally be a comfortable time.

Nevertheless, with a meal before them, what was this atmosphere, so uncomfortable, no, beyond uncomfortable, bordering on fear!

It was none other than—

Creak!

The door opened, and a hideous evil spirit revealed itself.

"Meat…! Meeeat…!"

"Gasp!"

"How dare you!"

"No!"

Someone leaped up in surprise, someone else fell backward in fright, while the eldest son displayed astonishing courage, leaping onto the table.

He embraced a dish of dongpo pork like a human shield, covering it with his body, as if to say, 'If you want to take the dongpo pork, you'll have to kill me first.'

It could be said to be a sublime manifestation of resolve that would make even the most heinous villain feel repentance… but.

The evil spirit seemed to have no human heart.

The evil spirit, the plague ghost, leaped in on all fours, gripped the table, and threw its arms up, celebrating a victory.

The first technique of grand earthly mayhem.

Flipping the table (掀桌子).

The table flew into the air, the eldest son was flung away, and dishes and their contents scattered everywhere.

Amidst this, the plague ghost's hands moved, leaving afterimages, and the dongpo pork floating in the air vanished one by one.

At the same time, the plague ghost's cheeks swelled!

What was dongpo pork!

A dish that was the crystallization of a mother's love, a wife's devotion, and meticulous care—made by boiling pork whole, then taking it out and frying it again, and then immersing it in precious yellow wine and watching it for two \textit{shichen} with delicate temperature control.

Now, that precious dish was evaporating.

It was truly ruthless plunder, disappearing as if in the blink of an eye, even pieces that had fallen to the floor were fearlessly picked up and devoured!

"Ah, no!"

The family despaired. It was utter despair.

Giving up even resistance, they watched with vacant expressions as the precious dish, painstakingly prepared by the wife from morning until present lunchtime, consuming most of her waking hours, vanished.

However.

"Sniff, sniff, sniff! Smell, delicious smell…!"

"Ah, no! Stop! Stop!"

The plague ghost rushed like a beast, burst through the door, and charged into the kitchen.

And then, lifting the lid of the pot, there was a large, uncut chunk of dongpo pork!

It was truly a devilish scheme: placing out a small portion of dongpo pork prepared in anticipation of the plague ghost's attack, and planning to eat the rest after the plague ghost retreated!

However, they underestimated the plague ghost's sense of smell.

Its sense of smell, which already transcended human limits, was so keen that even a dog, the best in the world at sniffing, would cover its nose in respect.

It was truly the best nose in the world!

Furthermore, it had a dog-like tongue that found anything and everything delicious!

This entity, indistinguishable as to whether it was a woman or a bitch, was none other than the plague ghost, Ximen Qing.

"W-why on earth! What grudge do you hold against us to do this!"

The resentment and despair over the vanished dongpo pork erupted in a desperate voice.

But the plague ghost merely turned slowly.

"You will receive divine retribution! You will receive divine retribution! How can a person interfere with even eating? Even if you hate beggars, you shouldn't break their bowls!"

Suddenly, a scene flashed through her mind.

A steamed bun, bitten once and discarded, rotting in the leftover bin, thoroughly soaked in putrid liquid—food waste that even animals wouldn't touch.

Even that, she swallowed hurriedly, hunched beneath a narrow wall, afraid of being discovered, eventually unable to bear it, tears bursting forth, yet unable to make a sound, acting like a mute.

\end{center}

Of course, at that time, she hid more because of the beggars' cruelty than the villagers'.

But the beggars were gone now.

Of course, the average Jianping resident also didn't just leave Qing alone when she was picking up food.

Poking, throwing stones, or if not that, flocking around her like they were watching a spectacle.

Still, it wasn't like they were trying to kill her outright, so it was just trivial harassment.

Therefore, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

Triviality for triviality.

It makes no sense to dismember and kill someone just because they were somewhat mean.

And those silent accomplices who indifferently neglected her then aren't exactly enemies either.

So, this much was just right.

A trivial revenge that's serious for the individual but utterly amusing from afar—a *gakseori* (wandering entertainer) who returned without dying, a new nuisance for the whole village.

Qing leaped away.

She felt somehow refreshed.

The unfortunate thing was that she should have done this back then.

Even then, her physical ability, exchanged for charm, was already at a level that could easily slap an ordinary man.

Yet, she waited for someone to extend a hand of warmth.

She endured the bullying, afraid of causing hatred by resisting.

She merely lingered visibly, as if to say, 'I'm pitiful, please pity me'.

Of course, the fault always lay with the people of Jianping.

It was entirely the one-sided fault of the people of Jianping, whose average character was unusually lower than the already low average character of this primitive, ancient Zhongyuan.

Qing chuckled, taking a big bite of the dongpo pork chunk.

The pork and fat melted as soon as they touched her teeth, truly soft and melting.

\textit{This incredibly rich and oily flavor.}

\textit{Wow, this place makes really good dongpo pork.}

\textit{It would easily beat most high-end inns. Well, inn dongpo pork was made quickly, so it's not simmered with such care, so it can't be helped.}

Qing sparkled her white teeth with a relieved smile.

February passed, and finally, March.

Though it was officially spring, past *Ipchun* (start of spring), the northern part of Liaoning was originally a cold region.

So, water still froze even in broad daylight, it would take another month for the ground to properly thaw and prepare for farming.

And it had been over ten days since the plague ghost began her rampage.

The residents of Jianping crowded into a magnificent manor's spacious courtyard, holding a complaint meeting with one heart.

Of course, Jianping had no official administrative seat.

And in such regions, local influential figures often acted as the officials.

These local influential figures, with the implicit permission of the government, were sometimes called powerful clans (Haozu), or sometimes called village chiefs or elders.

Jianping's elder was Oh Hak-gye, the master of the Oh Clan Estate, Oh Dae-in.

He was, in essence, the de facto ruler of Jianping, the real power.

He was also the person the residents would flock to and ask for help when something went wrong in Jianping.

"Dae-in, must we continue to tolerate that accursed beggar woman? We're absolutely dying!"

"She attacks like a ghost whenever we finally manage to prepare a special meal, and her mischief was beyond anything imaginable."

It was a truly trivial sight: adults, old enough to have children, gathering together and whimpering, 'That bitch stole our food!'

However, from an individual's perspective, it was not trivial.

Because of that plague ghost, the people of Jianping were driven absolutely insane.

Especially during this winter farming off-season, with no entertainment, the only pleasure in Zhongyuan was delicious food.

Meat was truly scarce in winter.

So, whenever they decided to prepare a special meal for the day, she would appear like a ghost, somehow knowing, steal the meat, and run away.

It wasn't just meat. Didn't she also come like a ghost and steal snacks?

"That bitch was incredibly strong, and her resilience was amazing. She just eats while getting beaten."

"The plague ghost's resilience is always something else. Wasn't she the one who was perfectly fine even after getting beaten so much by beggars?"

"Oh, don't even talk about it. She jumps around on all fours like she has some animal disease, so we don't even dare to touch her, Dae-in-nim, shouldn't something be done about her?"

"How much does she eat? She doesn't just hang around other people's tables all day. Just today, there's Oh-ssi from the hardware store, Oh-ssi from the broom shop, Oh-ssi who makes shoes, that innkeeper Oh-ssi, and Jang-ssi who climbs mountains, and…"

Remote villages inevitably take on the character of clan villages.

One out of every three villagers was a Wu, and the rest were Zang or Li. Jianping didn't have a particularly diverse range of surnames.

Anyway.

Meal times in Zhongyuan were not strictly fixed by national law, nor did they work regularly during the off-season.

So, meal times were arbitrary.

Therefore, the plague ghost's plunder continued all day long, regardless of the time.

Even though it had only been about ten days since the plague ghost began her rampage, the number of her victims had swelled like a snowball.

Of course, revenge was a serious matter in Zhongyuan.

However, that beggar woman was incredibly elusive.

Not only that.

Even?

"Sir, it's gotten to the point where she's openly stealing now!"

The residents of Jianping also put their heads together.

'Let's cut off the special meals before that beggar woman leaves.'

'If we just eat plain steamed dumplings and stir-fried grass, she'll get tired of it and move to another village, won't she?'

It was truly an astonishing resolution.

But then, she started breaking into kitchens and stealing uncooked meat.

And not just meat? She also stole dried fish, dried fruit, snacks, and even valuable ingredients like sugar and honey.

Even if they hid them carefully, she would find them like a ghost and run away with them.

Now, they were forced, against their will, to eat only grass in their rice, only grass in their dumplings, only soy sauce noodles with grass.

How could they cook anything without ingredients!

"Hmm."

Oh Hak-gye, the master of the Oh Clan Estate, let out an uncomfortable groan.

If you combine this groan with a slightly annoyed, yet somewhat pitying, or perhaps even an expression of looking at a foolish person?

It becomes a look that says, 'Have you ever seen such pathetic people in the world?'

At that, the people of Jianping slumped their shoulders.

Such was the terror of the plague ghost's revenge!

It was serious for them personally, but from a distance, it was utterly trivial.

If they were to complain about such a matter anywhere, they would merely become cripples who couldn't even handle one beggar woman and had their dinner table plundered.

The atrocities made their teeth clench and anger surge, but they couldn't speak of it anywhere.

They say that being disputed over food was the most sorrowful thing, the people of Jianping were precisely in that state now.

A trivial yet not trivial, and at the same time vulgar, dirty, and horrifying act.

This was Qing's revenge!

Of course, setting aside the triviality, the vulgarity was so extreme that one might wonder how such a vulgar woman could exist in the world.

"No, it's cold anyway, and the ground isn't thawing, so you must have nothing to do. Why don't you just grab sticks and go catch her? Why are you all gathered here causing a fuss?"

"Oh, Dae-in, wouldn't we have done that ourselves? But as soon as we rolled up our sleeves and go out, she somehow knew and hide again. She's incredibly cunning."

Hadn't they all already rushed out with sticks, seeking revenge for the special meal, for the grudge over the meat?

They had circled the city with murderous intent, vowing to break every bone in that plague ghost's legs today, to knock out all her teeth.

But she had to be visible for that to happen.

It was a very ghostly thing to do.

"Tsk tsk. Just one beggar, and a mere woman at that, and you're all flustered? What? You came running to tell on her? Oh, people, really."

At that, the people of Jianping bowed their heads low.

But that was only for a moment.

At his next words, everyone lifted their heads sharply.

"Hmph. Still, I can't ignore your grievances and hardships. Alright. I will send my warriors to capture her, and then you can boil her in soup or slice her up for sashimi, deal with her as you see fit. Is that settled?"

How could someone who loses the trust of the people maintain their position as a local influential figure?

Of course, they certainly could.

There were not just one or two bastards who wielded knives with cruelty and wickedness to dominate an area.

But Oh Hak-gye was not that kind of person.

And as with countless Oh-ssis, if you trace their genealogy upwards, they would converge into one family.

As for other surnames, isn't it the case that either the wife was an Oh-ssi or one of the mothers-in-law was an Oh-ssi?

They were not strangers.

At that, the residents of Jianping bent at the waist.

"Oh, thank you, Sir!"

"Indeed, only the elder can do this."

"We are always grateful, hehe."

And then they exchanged glances.

'Now, it's over. How to twist that bitch's guts after catching her, how to make the news of her vulgar end spread widely, and so on.'

They were already gulping down *sungnyung* (scorched rice tea) as if the problem were solved.

Well, it could happen.

No matter how intelligent someone is, no one in the world could imagine.

Could they even imagine that the plague ghost was hiding her strength?
