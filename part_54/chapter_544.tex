\chapter{Crossing Our Blooming Wall (5)}

The true energy gathered in the dantian was a small amount of internal energy that has taken the form of its owner.

They're divided into your side and my side, whispering and chattering, on one side they're running around and playing, and on the other side they're bickering.

Jeongjong's loyal subjects were sitting in a sunny spot, engaged in a stern and serious discussion.

In a dark place near the danjeon wall, the strange things were constantly looking around with wary eyes to see if the Hwanhee Jinki was there and will come after them again to harass them.

Today, too, the peaceful Qing Dynasty land.

The Qing dynasty's spirits have been breathing a little easier lately.

Now, even Jeongjong's true spirits have become quite skilled.

Anyway, we were letting these subhuman animals run wild to their hearts' content.

Recently, they were even encouraging it.

In the first place, the true energy of Taoism and Buddhism was also fundamentally a skill that can harm people, so if it was going to overflow and explode no matter how much you block it, then you can just release it on a bad guy.

Once you see blood properly like that, you won't have to worry for a while.

Since the remaining ambiguity was dealt with by turning the remaining evil spirit into the yin mind, there was no need to act like before, emptying the dantian and mobilizing all your energy to put out the fire in the upper dantian.

Thanks to that, even the magicians were dying.

Since Jeongjong's true energy was positioned right in the middle of the dantian, I am holding my breath while watching the situation.

Lately, it's been a perfect time to whisper evil words to the owner through the expression of his imperfect thoughts, but he's holding back even that out of caution.

To be exact, he watches the face of the Wolnyeojinki.

If it weren't for the protection of the expressionless, blue-clad, little Moon Girl Jin-gi, the magicians would have long ago melted into the Jin-gi fusion of the Girl's Hwanheegong and disappeared.

However, the Wolnyeojingi was strictly blocking the absorption and integration of the Girl's Hwanheegong, while not hiding her displeasure with the Magi.

That doesn't mean you can secretly plant a devilish seed in someone.

If they get caught, it's unlikely that the Wolnyeojingi will continue to maintain the status quo.

So the magicians were gloomy.

The owner was just really grumpy.

If you were born as a warrior, shouldn't you be able to challenge the world by bringing everyone to their knees with your natural abilities?

What if the earth was dyed with blood, and the world was flooded with sorrow and grief?

Rather than a peaceful world that was not mine, I must make it mine even if it burns like hell!

If I were to wrap it in fancy words, I would rather abandon the world than let the world abandon me!

It's exactly the way of thinking of the Sapa bastards and the Blood Cult bastards, that is, the scum of the earth who do not see people as people but only treat them as tools.

That's how it was in the first place, but I guess it's okay.

Anyway, the magicians were really sad.

So there was only one hope.

I wish the legendary magician would burst through the door and re-establish the order of the dantian.

So the magicians were pushed into the damp, cold shade, and spend all day looking only at the door of the dantian.

And then, finally! Bam!

The magicians suddenly rise up.

Oh! A super powerful legendary magician has appeared!?

Even the King's secret agents jumped up from their seats!

Is there a friend here to help me with the work!?

So, a new friend came in.

Wearing a skirt with a cute heart design on it-

Jeongjong's true spirits slump their shoulders.

If it were a normal Taoist Buddhist divine skill, it would not use such a strange and evil pattern.

The Magi were already in a festive mood.

Heart! Just looking at it, isn't it on our side?

The demon who had entered so confidently suddenly stopped.

This was because the large bundle he was carrying behind his back with both hands got stuck in the door of his dantian.

The demon lord struggles to pull the bundle, struggling to keep it together.

The bundle keeps growing longer, and it was a suspicious sight, as if it has been squirming and wriggling, as if it has been carrying someone in the middle of the night.

And then finally, bang!!

As the huge bundle that had been tightly packed away came out, the chill rolled around in the air.

And when you look around and turn around, your eyes will light up!

In the Subsimgong, the act of eating the heart was only a means, and the essence was a magical art of forcibly taking the true energy of another nature.

I came into my new house and what the heck, it's full of delicious treats. What was it? was it my birthday?

So the demon opens his mouth wide.

The round mouth opened wide and sharp shark teeth were arranged in a circle.

Hmph, that moment when a powerful force, stronger than even a super-powerful vacuum cleaner could dare to thrust, wrapped around and sucked in my danjeon-

Freeze!

The demonic spirit rolls around twice and wraps its arms around my head.

A dark shadow falls over the face of the Subsimmagi, who was holding large teardrops and raising several question marks that were not even in Zhongyuan.

The demon looks up.

A little girl with only a few strings wrapped around her naked body was standing with her legs wide open, showing off her fists without any shame.

Even the legendary prostitute Dalgi was not a lewd person, but a tyrant of the lower classes and a cruel military leader, Hwanhee Jinki, who possesses the true Taoist spirit.

The demonic spirit was roaring.

Hwanhee Jinki tilted his head.

The demon lord flinched.

Hwanhee Jinki was s …

Hwanhee Jinki puts his hand into the bundle of Subsimmagi.

The unrefined energy caught in the hand that came out soon, and the round soul fire that could not take the shape of its owner, was caught and wriggled.

Hwanhee Jinki looks at the soul with a sad expression and hugs it in his arms.

The trembling of the soul gradually becomes more comfortable, and soon it melts into the aura of joy and disappears without a trace.

The demon king was sweating profusely.

Of course, there must be a hierarchy in the internal energy method with the ability to absorb.

It was a sub-heart attack that takes at least ten years to force the heart in, compress it, and digest it.

Is it really necessary to measure who was superior among the girls who exchange their true energies with each other through the wind and rain and achieve a quick and pure union with joy, love, and pleasure?

Hwanhee Jinki points his finger towards the corner of the room.

The magician in his heart was crying, tears falling down his face.

But Hwanhee Jinki's expression was stern.

Seopsimmagi, who heads to the corner with his shoulders hunched, occasionally glances back at the bundle he had left behind with eyes full of regret.

The magicians were disappointed, but they all rush to the sadly crying Seopsimmagi and hug him tightly.

Then, whisper, whisper, whisper.

Seopsimmagi wiped away his tears and got up, walking slowly.

In one corner of the room, a small, hunched-over Heavenly Demon True Qi, wearing a martial arts uniform with human eyes engraved on it, raises his head at the sound of movement, or rather, a rustling sound.

Unreasonable violence strikes the Heavenly Demon True Qi!

Get slapped in Jiangnan and vent your anger in Cheonsan!

The Heavenly Demon True Qi, crouching with his head held high, lets out a pitiful laugh.

There was a brief commotion, but it was still a peaceful country.

Heavenly Demon True Qi was smiling again today… …

"Ugh, ugh, ugh……"

The howling of beasts echoes throughout the place.

The source of the sound was none other than Seopsimmahee Yuryang, lying face down in a strange position on the bathroom floor.

A strange posture, lying face down with only the forehead, both knees, and the tips of the toes touching the floor, neither bowing nor submitting.

It was a posture that instinctively takes place in the midst of excruciating pain that makes it impossible to think, as any touch of the ripened area causes excruciating pain.

The posture with the least contact with the ground.

Qing looks down at the sight with an indifferent gaze, then looks back at the boiling soup.

There's a subtle hint of blood, oh, this.

Come to think of it, this bath was no longer usable.

Besides, filling the bath with water was not an easy task, so I felt a bit sorry for the guests.

"Okay. What were you going to do now? were you really going to strip me of my clothes like this? My flesh has already melted into the clothing, so I'll just peel off my skin and all."

"No. was this the end? If I'm lucky, I might buy something. But from now on, I'll just sell it."

That's what I'm saying, but in my opinion as a doctor, she's already as good as dead.

Still, it's amazing that he didn't suffocate in pain just because he was a master, or maybe it's just reaping what you sow, since he reached that level by stealing people's hearts anyway.

"Oh my, won't you have mercy?"

"What mercy? A peaceful death was a luxury for a bitch like this."

You too, Qing swallowed his words.

Yun Yuanying just smiled, not knowing whether she knew Qing's dark intentions or not.

"Compassion was something you give because you need it, right? Isn't that good for you, Miss Ximen?"

"Okay, okay now? I'm going."

It's truly heartbreaking to have to leave this vicious boss alone, but there's no other way.

There was no choice but to quickly raise the level.

Man, that damn thing just keeps on giving me the medicine, and it's really over in no time.

"Hmm. You're being quite harsh. Do you have any questions for me? I'd be happy to answer them now."

Qing frowned at him.

No matter how you look at it, it's an obvious trick.

"Oh my. Really? The bathing experience that Lady Ximen gave me was truly special. How should I put it? It was ticklish, but different from a ticklish feeling? What could it have been?"

Qing squints her eyes.

This bitch, this?

Qing pretends to respond bluntly.

"Speak. Speak. If you say it like that, how will I know?"

"Hmm… I feel a burning sensation rising, and before I know it, my breathing quickens. My heart feels like it's been a long time since I've felt it. Along the Du meridian from the perineum, I feel a dull, something, something, um, something I've never felt before… I don't know. But, um. I don't know."

For reference, the perineum point was located in the center of the lower pelvis, and the Du meridian was a large acupoint that runs along the lower spine.

Yun Yuanying was rambling on and on, her expression truly confused.

Hey, you bitch, look at this?

Qing has found a clue to conquering the final boss.

Qing suddenly stopped talking and spoke rudely again.

"Well, let's try it again and we'll see."

"Oh my. It's so nice to hear from you, but I have my own schedule. Unfortunately, shall we meet again next time? You want to get back soon, don't you?"

Oh, Akabi. I could have just sent him away and sent him to the afterlife as well.

Qing suppresses her regret.

If you recommend it more, you will lose even the smallest possibility.

Anyway, was that why you seemed so happy?

"Okay. Then why were you doing this to me? was being a blood poisoner that important?"

"Oh my. That's foul play? Can't I answer that?"

"No, you said you would answer."

"Okay. So, what next?"

"What exactly was a blood poisoner?"

"Oh my. You want to ask someone else about your work? You can't."

"No, what? Then what's your purpose? Why were you going into the Blood Cult and pretending to help?"

"It's personal. Even if you're my dear friend, there were things I want to keep hidden, right?"

"Do you have any weaknesses?"

"Is this how I feel towards Miss Ximen?"

"Have you by any chance learned some amazing new technique? Could you teach me some?"

"The only things I learned through self-defense were the Unga Kwon and Saengsim Gyeol. But even empty words aren't enough to call it a divine skill. I've hidden the secrets in the Wulin Alliance's archives under the title 'Human Development Theory Based on Sword Forms Based on Records of the Sui and Tang Dynasties.' Feel free to learn them."

"No, even if you title it like that. Um, so what exactly was the realm? Life and death? Or something beyond that?"

"You can't answer that? It's not that I'm hiding it, it's that I truly can't answer it. There's no answer."

The veins on his forehead flared up!

"No, why were you asking me questions when you can't even give me a single proper answer? Ha. I knew this would happen. Done. I knew this would happen."

I really knew this would happen.

Still, I asked just in case.

Anyway, it wasn't a loss, except that I was reminded of what an annoying bitch she is.

"Hehehe. Well, that's enough now."

And then, suddenly, it was Yun Yuanying who lay down on the ground.

At the same time, women rushed into the bathroom and clung to Yun Yuanying, and then Yulno's corpse floated up and took its place on top of her-

Yulno's corpse shatters in the air with a strange cracking sound.

Blood, flesh, and internal organs pour out from the bodies of Yun Yuanying and the three women below.

"Now, what the hell were you doing-"

"Kwaaak!!" "Mama!?" "Mahee!!"

In an instant, all kinds of voices resonated throughout the old floor.

There were also inhuman screams, and the voices that raise their voices were clearly those of the Seopsimmahee River.

Oh my, Qing.

This bitch, you weren't even trying to answer in the first place, you were just trying to stall for time until the Blood Cult guys showed up.
