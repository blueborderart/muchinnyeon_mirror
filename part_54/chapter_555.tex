\chapter{Crossing Our Blooming Wall (16)}

The Tathagata of the Blue Heaven has used it many times and let people hear the sound of the temple bell.

But this time the tone was different from usual, more majestic and grand, and it dug deep into my heart, leaving a lingering aftertaste.

The word "beom" in the temple bell refers to the operating principle that encompasses everything, all things in the universe, the movement of heaven and earth, the cycle of karma, and the cycle of birth, aging, illness, and death of all living things.

Thus, the sound of the temple bell was the purest sound in the world, a word that cuts off people's worries and cleanses their hearts.

Maybe that's why.

Everyone in the room follows that sound.

Even the blood demons, the low-ranking blood demons who were simply devouring the Sapa warriors with greed, erased the devilish gaze from their eyes for a moment and turned their heads to find the source of a clear sound.

For the Half Swordsmanship Society, it was the sound they had been waiting for, and it was also the most welcome sound.

Everyone was beaming, some with small, sly smiles, some with bright smiles, some with a sigh of relief as if they had believed in it. Their hearts were filled with joy and delight, and they couldn't help but turn their heads to look for their owners.

In a place where everyone's eyes were focused, a man stands tall with his arms outstretched in a proud manner.

A woman who was covered in blood, with no natural color anywhere on her body, yet still retains her beauty.

In an instant, all the fighting stopped and the whole place was quiet, a silence filled with the chirping of birds.

It was a moment when someone gulped.

The bloody lips of the beauty open.

"Ah, oh no, I'm falling behind, I'm dying……"

And then the iron fist.

Still, a new type of woman who falls apart.

For a moment, a question mark that did not yet exist in Zhongyuan seemed to appear above everyone's heads.

……? what?

A flash of light? The moment before sunset was the most splendid? A final, desperate shot?

"Qing'er!" "Qing!" "Ximen Sojo!"

My friends' voices were ringing with urgency.

As soon as Qing opened her eyes, what she saw was a graceful, swirling dance.

Mo Yong-ju dances.

Geumyang Geomhwa, the nickname given by the people of the world because the geomhwa's form was truly like a golden yang, like silk fluttering in the wind, was a Yunmu.

One was a straight and strong straight sword.

One was a thin, soft, and curved sword.

Spreading his two swords like wings, he rotated his body, his long sleeves fluttering leisurely like a butterfly.

Blood demons rush in, clawing at the air, and swirling around, blood spurting out with every sword they pass!

A strange beauty that catches the eye as it seems to move at half-speed alone in twice the time.

Suddenly our eyes meet, but we don't meet.

Looking into the distance, hazy and out of focus, isn't it the appearance of attaining enlightenment and entering into a state of no-self?

Looking at that magnificent beauty and pretty Miss Mo Yong, it seems like everyone was holding on strong.

It was a time when Qing was somewhat at ease.

Kkwarung! The sound of a huge thunderclap rings out.

Qing's gaze turns around urgently.

My eyes widen, and without realizing it, I jump up and stretch out my hand, pushing the air.

The seal of Amitabha, where the middle finger and thumb were vaguely facing each other at a distance of one joint, and the sound of truth resonating throughout the world.

And then, uh. Uh, me, me now, what.

A severe pain that makes it impossible to even make a sound.

Before I knew it, I was suffocating, my lungs tightening, and in an instant, thick sweat began to form on my forehead and back, and my sweat glands stung as if needles had been stuck in them.

Qing lowers his head with a creaking sound.

A long, wide wound extending from the shoulder to the thigh above the knee, past the navel, completely filled with a bloody paste.

The pain that has been postponed until now, the pain that has been mentally rejected and postponed until now, suddenly comes rushing back.

It was the will of heaven to punish the fool who did not know the value of his own body and ran wild, injuring it. It was a terrible pain like a divine punishment.

Me, me, what, what state am I in right now?

How were you alive, how were you alive?

It seemed as if I had unconsciously let out a cry for help.

I don't even know what I said, I feel dizzy, the lights go out.

And then, ahhhhh… … !

His body twisted and his wounds followed him, and in exchange for losing consciousness for a moment, he said, "Keep killing me, I'll tell you everything, save the person, really."

"Qing!" "Qing'er!" "Ximen Sojo!"

If it weren't for the voices piercing into my ears, I would have been trembling and shaking.

But in an instant, I felt like my soul, which had leaked out of my mouth, was suddenly returning.

Qing grits his teeth, lifts his torso on his arms, places his left foot on the ground, presses his knees desperately, and finally gets up again.

So, he lifts the Unwol-do and points to Changsan-ya, aiming at the end of the cold moon.

Even though his legs were shaking and his arms were shaking, it was obvious to anyone that he wasn't in a good state.

Still, I have the energy to swing it once, just once.

I can't even imagine what kind of backlash will follow after that, but still, thanks.

The last chance we got by reaching Hwagyeong, we can all eat together, a feast prepared, yes, food, food was important.

You have to eat to live.

We should eat together and live together.

"Hey, old man. Stop bullying the weak and come at me."

My voice got distorted and cracked in the middle of the song. But now, shouldn't I be praised for not screaming?

"You, you bitch!"

"Hey! You're going to learn martial arts and then deal with kids? What kind of youthful rejuvenation can you get if you act like a child when you're already old? Tsk, was it something to brag about that you've aged so much? If I were you, I'd rather stick my nose in beef stew and kill myself than grow old so shamefully like you."

It's a dirty sound coming from a pretty mouth.

But the effect was tremendous.

It was a terrible provocation for the already angry Mine, who had now lost all sense of anger.

By now, hey, old punk, if you'd only heard six words, you'd have rolled your eyes. But since Qing didn't know about those circumstances, he just kept talking.

Because I don't have the confidence to go that far.

Then, the enemy must come.

Knock! The vibration reaches the soles of Qing's feet with a fierce awakening.

A new type of Changsanya that charges forward with incredible speed and ferocity.

Qing takes that sight in with her large eyes.

He takes a deep breath when he sees the enemy, right foot left foot, right foot left foot, Qingi reads the subtle difference.

Oh, kid, your left foot was uncomfortable right now.

Qing held high the Iron-Chu-Eonwol-Dao-

Then the world obeys and follows Qing.

The world was tilting.

The earth was tilting.

The back of the Cheonhwa Sword sinks and the front rises, and the world turns upside down as heaven and earth try to switch places.

The vertical ground, the Changsanya that approaches with one's feet planted on it, was more like a fall than a dash.

It was a shape that falls vertically when the earth rises like a cliff.

Changsanya has doubts.

The world moves and pushes him towards the blade.

Like a ship capsizing in a typhoon, the earth has turned over and my body was lying horizontally, so isn't it like I'm being sucked into the vicious blade of the moon sword and throwing myself into it?

Everyone in the room sees this strange sight.

When I witnessed the universe turning over at the sound of the temple bell, the mere human will was powerless and I couldn't move a single finger.

Hardened like a stone, I can only look at it.

The world was turned upside down.

There was only one in it.

Stop and do not move.

A single sword stands upright without moving, and suddenly a realization strikes: Ah, the center of the world was right there.

Changsanya looks up at the sky blankly, looking down at the sky beneath her head.

The crescent moon was near, the blade of the moon sword.

In the face of death, Changsanya uses her last strength to push off the ground she was standing on with one foot while running.

A tingle, a moment, a surge of electricity shoots up my thigh.

Rather, I lost strength and my body tilted.

Ah. That. That damn bastard, that guy with a smooth face-

It was Changsanya's last thought.

The earth throws itself and slams its torso into the moon.

A world turned upside down, sunrise, and a land of hope.

The dawn sky spreads out beneath my feet, and the sun sinks into the endless cliff, casting a brilliant color, while the earth closes in above like a ceiling.

Only one weapon remained in its place.

Because it was the center of the world.

%\end{figure}

At some point the world turns around.

The expression "I came back" would not be accurate.

Like a long spring dream, like an illusion, it was nothing more than a mirage that suddenly disappeared.

Ugh, the sound of people gasping for air or spitting out air was loud here and there.

And then all of a sudden, the new model staggered.

Because I was standing upside down in an upside down world.

\textbf{Solitary Nine Swords, First Movement. Only I Am Supreme.}

When you exist alone in the world, this was the time to stand as the master of heaven and earth and the universe.

If the sword had eyes and could see the world, wouldn't you be immobile, and as the enemy approaches, wouldn't the world move, turning left and right, upside down, and rotating to the east, west, south, and north?

If a warrior, sharpened with a single sword, stood as the master of the world, the sword would not move at all.

Later, Changsanya falls to the left and right.

The body, split exactly in half, was spewing out its contents from the messy cross-section, steam rising from the air.

Qing exhales deeply.

\textit{Have you seen this crazy old man, Mucheon Daeje?}

\textit{The most advanced swordsmansip of all time, Solitary Nine Swords, created with all his desires, a violent thought that dyes the entire universe with his colors from beginning to end.}

\textit{But, um.}

\textit{I don't really get along with Grandfather Mucheon.}

\textit{Being alone in the world, isn't that terrible?}

\textit{This old man was also a friendless man.}

\textit{But in the vaguely glimpsed realm of the heavenly realm, a loneliness that the martial artists inevitably encounters, a fate that must ultimately proceed alone, vaguely stabs my heart in an unclear form.}

\textit{No matter how much learning develops, ultimately, training is something that one achieves on one's own, alone, and by oneself.}

\textit{There comes a time when you have to make a decision-}

"Cough."

Qing coughed shallowly once.

And, phew!

The barely contained bleeding bursts out violently.

All the muscles begin to cramp and cramp, and tiny cracks spread through every bone.

Her vision was red and she couldn't see ahead, blood was welling up in her nasal passages and flowing down her nose and mouth, and her ears were filled with silence, the sounds of the world disappeared, and only the sensation of thick liquid flowing was present.

Well, of course she knew it would turn out like this.

The higher the level of consciousness, the more clearly it appears, and even if one's body were normal, it would be difficult to fully handle and imitate this high-level martial arts.

How could she be safe when she spread out her body in such a tattered state that you'd think, 'Wow, how is she even alive?'

\textit{But, I did enough, right?}

\textit{There is absolutely no need to force myself to hold on to my conciousness now, and then endure the terrible backlash of hellfire with my whole mind.}

\textit{Because I have friends.}

\textit{Even if I break and shatter and fall, I can entrust myself to someone who will take care of me, look after me, and be a little more resourceful.}

\textit{Okay. Can I leave the rest to you?}

\textit{I've done enough, so I'm going to take a break now.}

Qing, without realizing it, lets out a yo-yo smile.

\textit{It's so comforting to be able to leave things to someone and just fall down.}

\textit{Was I being too foolish?}

\textit{What would have happened if I had brought the treasure map and asked for help from the Wulin Alliance from the beginning?}

\textit{Or, if it was an act of apology or a way to push the old woman, I would have asked the Master for help.}

\textit{Maybe I should just come to Hangzhou with General Wang Shuanglong and his troops.}

\textit{Oh, but.}

\textit{Isn't this a revolving lantern\footnote{走馬燈; also an idiom for near-death experience}?}

\textit{If I do it wrong, I'll really die…}

And then, the lights went out.
