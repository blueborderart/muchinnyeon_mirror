\chapter{Journey to Changbai Mountain (3)}

From the Divine Maiden Sect to Changbai Mountain, it was roughly six thousand li along the road.

If this was converted into the most widely used scientific, precise, universally common unit system of Qing's homeland – Seoul-Busan?

A whopping six Seoul-Busans!

Or three Seoul-Busans, round trip!

To walk such a distance?

It was an impossible feat for the weak civilized people of Qing's homeland, whose physical abilities have degenerated.

But what about Zhongyuan people?

'Six thousand li? Tsk, it's far, but if you keep going, you'll get there quickly, won't you? Once you set off, you'll arrive someday. Let's just go.'

It was truly the demeanor of a great master.

In fact, humanity in this era was closer to primitive people before the advent of civilization, that is, proto-humans or hominids.

Isn't it basic common sense that all people in Qing's hometown agree that human civilization began with the discovery of electronic communication technology (global wide-area communication networks)?

Surprisingly, proto-humans from the pre-electronic communication era solved such communication by running on two feet, and thus, with their developed physical abilities, six thousand li was not such a difficult task!

In fact, even the weak people of Qing's homeland, if they joined the military, possessed the potential ability to march one hundred li overnight carrying loads.

This was the great potential of humans, so what was it like in this ancient era?

The ordinary people of Zhongyuan, farmers, innkeepers, mountain folk, peddlers, porters, escorts, and so on, walked all day long.

Those people, with a slight exaggeration, walked at least one hundred li a day.

So, six thousand li?

Six thousand li was a distance that can be reached by walking just one hundred li a day for only two months, so it was not such a difficult task.

(Of course, it would be economically difficult, and one would have to survive various challenges posed by different types of bandits.)

In that sense, the journey to Changbai Mountain was not difficult or an unreasonable schedule for Qing; it was just a bit annoying.

Qing's life in Zhongyuan has exceeded ten years, rounded up.

What if it's not rounded up, but rounded up to the nearest ten?

Twenty years, fifty years, one hundred years, it would not be a lie to say that if we round up her Zhongyuan life to the nearest ten thousand units, it reaches ten thousand years!

So Qing has now shed the appearance of an outsider and has become quite integrated into the culture of Zhongyuan.

Qing's mindset when departing for Changbai Mountain was precisely at this level.

\textit{The remote edge of Changbai Mountain?}

\textit{Damn, how annoying. I'll just go and come back quickly.}

First, by boat to Jingzhou.

\textit{If I take a slight detour, I could stop by Wuhan and see Xiang'er's face.}

However, if she went to the Zhuge Family, she'd have to stay for two days, and a guest leaving too quickly was considered rude in Zhongyuan.

The road was long, so she'd pass.

From Jingzhou, take the highway north to Henan Province.

There was Mount Song on the way, but Master Wu Xue was in Xizhang, and even if he were there, Shaolin Temple was a sacred place forbidden to women, so a visit was not possible.

\textit{I could make a slight detour to the Wulin Alliance, but I'll pass on my back anyway.}

\textit{If I greet everyone here and there, what's two days? If I greet them, they'll surely ask me to show my face at the Dragon-Phoenix Assembly.}

So, she passed through Mount Song, where Shaolin was located.

After crossing the Yellow River, her heart stirred slightly again.

Well, if she head north from there, there was Taiyuan in Shanxi Province, and in Taiyuan, there was the Hanlin Academy, the best educational institution in Zhongyuan.

And in the Hanlin Academy, the Grand Academician Tian Youxue was a respected scholar, but his true identity was surprisingly the Divine Thief, the greatest thief under heaven!

And he was also Qing's Master.

\textit{It's been a long time since I've seen Master, hasn't it…?}

\textit{However, it was uncertain whether Master is in Taiyuan or not.}

And given Tian Youxue's personality and his active work as the Divine Thief, it was highly probable that he was absent.

\textit{My apologies, but I'll pass for now.}

North to Hebei Province!

There were two main routes from Hebei to Liaoning.

There's a well-maintained good road and a rough road.

The well-maintained road passes through Shanhai Pass\footnote{Popularly known as 'Greatest Pass Under Heaven' and 'where the Great Wall meets the Bohai Sea'. Battle of Shanhai Pass was the starting point of Qing Dynasty's rule over China proper} in the south, a perfectly paved, super-wide road at least one zhang wide.

The rough road was a mountain path crossing the mountain range further north.

Since it's a mountain path, it's naturally rough.

The confrontation between a well-maintained road and a rough mountain path.

In fact, whether these two constituted a 'confrontation' or where to go if one had to choose between them was very clear.

But the problem lay in the city that appeared after crossing the northern mountain path.

After passing through the northern mountain path of Hebei, beyond the small villages and towns, appeared the first proper-sized city.

Its name was Jianping!

What kind of city was Jianping!

The city where the Jianghu journey of the Heavenly Blossom Sword, the greatest rising star of the current Wulin, began!

When she closed her eyes, it appeared, and when she fell asleep, that time became clear, never to be forgotten, and thus, a spiritual home that she must one day return to!

The city of the cruelest people, chosen by the Heavenly Blossom Sword.

The city of the most heartless people.

The most inhuman and inhumane city, and the most utterly ill-mannered city.

Is that all?

The city of blind people who did not recognize the phoenix chick (a young phoenix) that rolled in!

Did they only fail to recognize it? They even mistreated it, earning hatred, a city of unparalleled idiots under heaven!

This profoundly wicked and brazen demonic realm, where only non-humans, those who failed to adhere to even one of the human ways, gathering like beasts.

Truly, it could be called a hell on earth.

That was Jianping!

However, before that.

To head from the southern end of Hebei to Liaoning?

One must pass through either Beijing or Tianjin.

And in this era, Tianjin was like a sacred place for Zhongyuan tourism, a place that female martial artists and travelers had to visit at least once in their lives.

Because the Peng Family of Hebei was in Tianjin!

They say that because of the female travelers flocking there, believing that if a woman was born, she must see the benevolent face of the Jade Qilin once before she dies, Tianjin's commercial district screams happily every day.

Qing pondered for a moment.

\textit{Chaolei earnestly, earnestly, pleaded with me to visit, but somehow I still haven't been able to…}

\textit{But, sorry to Chaolei.}

\textit{I can't go to Tianjin now.}

\textit{Because I have to stop by Beijing.}

\textit{Chaolei will have no choice but to understand this.}

\textit{Because Beijing has Peking duck.}

Peng Chaolei might feel unjustly treated, or rather, extremely angry.

'Is it true that the great Hebei Peng Clan, the hegemon of Hebei… well, not quite the hegemon, but at least something similar to the pinnacle of the Five Great Clans of Wulin, was demoted in priority to mere Peking duck?'

But it's not just any Peking duck.

It's the Ultimate Peking Duck!

\textit{Besides, even if I visit the Hebei Peng Clan now, I don't know if San has returned because I'm in such a hurry, and he's obviously probably still wandering around in some strict place.}

\textit{I'll stop by the Hebei's Peng Clan on the way back.}

"Hahaha, I'm here…!"

It was late February.

On the forty-second day of his journey to Changbai, Qing finally arrived at this sacred place, famous for Beijing's most renowned restaurant, Beijing's First Cuisine.

Beijing's First Cuisine Restaurant, Beijing Pavilion!

If one dared to use the name representing a city, one must naturally possessed the appropriate ability.

So, it could be said that it's natural for the most delicious restaurant in Beijing to dare to use Beijing's name.

\textit{But Beijing Pavilion… it feels very familiar.}

\textit{Then, perhaps the Forbidden City Restaurant exists too?}

Of course, there would be no bold restaurant owner who would dare to mention the Forbidden City.

If you want to die, you should die gracefully alone, unless you want all nine generations of your family dragged to the slaughterhouse.

As Qing approached Beijing Pavilion, the doorman quickly blocked her path.

"This Beijing Pavilion operates on a reservation basis. If you wish to make a reservation, it's possible from late August, but-"

The doorman scanned Qing up and down.

Her face veil was high-quality, but her clothes were not.

A woman wearing a face veil was a common sight these days, nothing surprising, so she seemed to have used a high-quality veil for the sake of being a 'Heavenly Blossom Lady.'

The doorman continued.

"Reservations require a down payment of one tael of gold."

His words clearly implied, 'Can you even afford it?'

Of course, Qing's personality was not so low as to be offended by that.

Such people were common, after all.

Perhaps a type of person who mistakes the prestige of their affiliated group for their own prestige, or rather, it's not even the group's prestige to begin with.

Since it's the most successful restaurant in Beijing, what kind of guests would it have?

When dealing with important people, a doorman might felt like he's someone important himself.

But in Qing's eyes, well, if it happens, great, if not, so be it.

In reality, a restaurant claiming to be the best in the heart of Zhongyuan couldn't possibly be a place where one could simply walk in with money and eat.

Didn't the Ultimate Malatang of Sichuan's Best Chef, Baek Changja, prove that?

However, Qing also had something she believed in.

The chef of Beijing Pavilion was said to enter the Imperial Palace a couple of times a season to cook Peking duck, and Gabi would passionately rave about how delicious it was.

It was, in other words, the Ultimate Peking Duck!

It was a time Qing eagerly awaited when she was in the palace.

Regrettably, however, the opportunity to taste that incredible Ultimate Peking Duck never arose during Qing's stay in the palace.

So, the Empress had told her that she would put her name down, and if she felt like it later, she should go.

However, the situation was uncertain.

She might have genuinely come without realizing, or it might have just been a casual remark like 'Let's eat sometime later'.

For that reason, Qing's voice slightly trailed off.

"Um, if you say Qing of Dongguan Yuan Clan…"

"Gasp! Please wait a moment, just a moment!"

And so, it was just a moment, truly just a moment.

There was a clattering sound of something falling, and then a man in silk robes came limping out.

"Thank you for gracing us with your presence! I shall escort you this way!"

\textit{Perhaps I knew this would happen.}

\textit{Am I also addicted to the sweetness of power?}

Qing cautioned herself and reflected slightly.

"Oh, oh, delicious, khuhuhu."

Qing chewed on the Peking duck skin, repeatedly exclaiming how delicious it was.

Crispy yet chewy, the texture was excellent.

Rich in fat, yet light.

Expressions that seemingly couldn't be combined coexisted harmoniously. Was this truly the pinnacle of Zhongyuan duck cuisine, the Ultimate Peking Duck!

\textit{However. Hmm, the meat is a bit dry.}

\textit{It's just roasted duck, isn't it?}

Well, Peking duck was a dish where you eat the skin.

Peking duck was precisely that dish where you carefully peel off and eat only the skin, and then give the rest of the meat to the servants.

Qing chewed on the duck meat and stared blankly out beyond the railing of the private room.

As she gazed down at the roughly organized Beijing, Qing fell into thought.

It was a thought about Jianping.

\textit{Did Jianping truly wrong me?}

\textit{Giving food to a beggar was generally considered a benevolent act.}

\textit{Of course, if one were to delve deeper, there might be a social discourse questioning how helping a beggar who has no intention of laboring or integrating into society could be a benevolent act in the first place.}

\textit{But what if you don't give food to a beggar?}

\textit{Is turning away from a beggar an evil act?}

\textit{Anyone could answer it confidently.}

\textit{'Of course not.'}

\textit{So, can it be considered a sin if the people of Jianping didn't bestow kindness upon a beggar who had something nasty all over her face and looked quite unhygienic?}

\textit{From my perspective, they were cold-hearted and heartless bastards.}

\textit{But not showing warmth in the past is not something worth seeking revenge for, is it?}

\textit{Yes, perhaps they were struggling to make a living too.}

\textit{After all, isn't it human nature for a person to prioritize one piece of candy for themselves over a penny to donate to a beggar?}

\textit{That cannot be criticized as selfish.}

\textit{And the plague demon of the past was no more…}

\textit{Only the martial arts saint, the great, super-duper master Heavenly Blossom Sword, who can simply walk into the Beijing Pavilion on the day of hes arrival and order one dish per person—no, one duck per person—remains.}

"Yes. It's Weiwang."\footnote{未亡, describing someone who escaped destruction. From the Epitaph of King Cao Ceng, composed by Han Yu}

\textit{I just couldn't forget.}

\textit{Because the sorrow of the past is too bitter.}

\textit{Thinking about it now, perhaps I needed someone to hate.}

\textit{Falling into some primitive era, far away in a foreign land—no, it would be fortunate if only the distance was far, but it was also distant in time.}

\textit{Perhaps I couldn't bear the misfortune that befell me, for which no one was to blame, so I had to resent someone, anyone, to keep my heart from festering and survive.}

Qing quietly closed her eyes.

\textit{Yes, let's forget.}

\textit{Weiwang means not yet forgotten.}

\textit{'Yet' ultimately means that one must forget someday, so isn't it a thorn lodged in my heart that torments me?}

In Qing's mind, those terrible moments from the first year of her martial arts journey in the past flashed by.

\textit{Yes, it's all in the past.}

\textit{Forget it, I must forget it…}

\textit{I must forget it…?}

Qing's eyebrow twitched.

In Qing's memory, the plague demon, whose face was covered by its hair, was thoroughly beaten.

Kicked, stomped on, hit with clubs, struck with chairs, flying sticks, shoes, rocks, all sorts of filth and trash…

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{part_86/beggar_flashback}
\end{center}

However, surprisingly, in the recollection, there were almost no punches reaching the beaten plague demon.

As Qing wondered, a certain line of dialogue suddenly auto-played.

-Hey, calm down, calm down.

-What? Let go! I'm going to totally mess up that bitch. Don't stop me.

-No, I'm not stopping you, but you might get infected if you touch her bare skin, so hit her with a stick.

A vein popped in Qing's forehead.

\textit{Come to think of it, these inhuman beast-like bastards of Jianping didn't just fail to show warmth.}

\textit{They were going beat me to near death to chase me away, no, they wouldn't even care if I had died.}

\textit{Not bestowing kindness upon a beggar was not a sin.}

\textit{But if you beat a beggar, that's a sin, right?}

\textit{From the beggar's perspective, isn't it a justifiable reason for revenge?}

A chilling smile spread across Qing's lips.

You bastards, just you wait.

The plague demon will return.

The Return of the Plague Demon! The Plague's Reincarnation!
