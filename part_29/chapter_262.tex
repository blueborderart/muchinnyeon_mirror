\chapter{The Appearance of the Divine Dragon (17)}

The Yue Maiden Sword was an incredibly inconvenient swordsmanship.

As the length, weight, and shape of the most suitable sword differed for each movement, some movements could not be performed at all.

Moreover, it didn't distinguish between swords and daos, which, as Namgung Shinjae had said, was probably because it was a sword art from a distant past when the two were not differentiated and were simply called swords.

\textit{Hmm. Sword Friend, Sword Friend, whatever. He might become a Sword Hater in the future.}

\textit{He seemed well-versed in swords, but he was wrong this time.}

The Yue Maiden Sword did not use different swords.

It just happened to be that what she held in her hand was a sword.

Long branches, short branches, swaying willow branches, pokers, iron rods, even without a blade, whether single-edged or double-edged, as long as it was held in the hand, it was a sword.

Suddenly, Qing realized she was standing in front of a wall.

A wall so high it completely filled her vision.

A barrier that blocked the view beyond, built up to the sky, seemingly impenetrable and isolating the world.

She saw a massive iron gate embedded in it.

It was so wide that one would have to run from side to side, with enormous hinges twice the size of Qing's torso extending endlessly upward.

Qing burst into a snicker.

Despite its solemn appearance, the things attached to it were noticeable, like tiny specks of dust on a grand canvas.

With various shapes and languages, the no-entry signs were cluttered and disorderly, reminiscent of some kind of modern art.

\textit{Alright. So, this is what it means to 'break through a wall', huh?}

\textit{Is there really a wall? Open the door and I'll reach the Transcendent Realm, right?}

\textit{Then, I should just go out.}

Qing cracked her hands together and then clasped her palms tightly.

And then, she pushed with all her might.

Creak. The gate groaned out a dull cry.

Qing pushed the gate with all her strength.

And then, she suddenly heard a voice.

\textit{\textbf{Hey, are you trying to go beyond?}}

Qing turned her head to see a young girl holding a beautifully crafted
branch, looking at her. It was so well-crafted that even though it was
just a piece of wood, one would desire to possess it.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

\textit{Hmm, is that perhaps the Nine Heavens Mysterious Maiden?}

\textit{\textbf{What does that even matter? But are you really going out there? Do you know what's out there? Are you not afraid? Don't you know the saying that it's dangerous outside the blanket? If it's dangerous outside the blanket, are you really going out there?}}

Qing hesitated.

\textit{Uh. Is this… maybe a bit dangerous?}

At that, the child burst into a fit of giggles.

\textit{\textbf{Beyond is a world of starlight. Listen.}}

\textit{\textbf{The immense malice beyond, waiting for you to come, waiting to devour you. Can you hear it?}}

From beyond the wall, a great roar shook the earth. A cry that was the very essence of malice.

It was a call for Qing.

'Come quickly. I am waiting for you.'

'The trivial pain you've felt in your life is nothing but a joke, not true pain.'


It was a threat that promised to imprison her in eternal agony, where each organ would be detached and displayed, yet she would not be allowed to die.

Qing's legs trembled. Not just her legs.

Her hands, her body, her jaw trembled uncontrollably, chattering her teeth, because she was afraid, so very afraid of what lurked beyond.

\textit{\textbf{See? It's better to just wait patiently, right?}}

\textit{\textbf{If you wait, a solution will eventually come to you, won't it? The mission to reach the Transcendent Realm will appear someday. You don't need to go beyond that wall, where you don't know what lurks, where you can't even catch a glimpse. Just wait here in safety.}}

But even though Qing trembled, she did not fall or sit down.

Qing looked at the child again. And shook her head.

\textit{What? I thought you are the Nine Heavens Mysterious Maiden. But you're not.}

Then, the child grew rapidly, taking on the form of a woman. A stunningly beautiful girl, one she always saw whenever she looked in the mirror, a beauty so surprising she was startled every time she saw it.

An unsurpassed beauty that never got old no matter how many times she saw it, as it was always thrilling.

Qing reached out her hand towards herself. 

\textit{Give it to me.}

But Qing's reflection shook her head, stepping back and away, urging her to stop.

\textit{\textbf{Not yet. Let's wait. If we wait, it will be resolved.}}

\textit{\textbf{Can you really handle that, the malice beyond?}}

Even with her body still trembling, Qing smiled.

\textit{You're going to give it even if I didn't ask for it. It's mine anyway, even if you don't give it to me, you know?}

And then, a sword appeared in Qing's hand.

A shabby, rusty, half-broken sword.

\textit{Yes. It's been a while. It seems the Moonlight Sword has been starving.}

\textit{I must have been careless not to feed it all this time.}

Tomorrow is always frightening. The unknown malice always lies in tomorrow.

But has there ever been a time when she knew what tomorrow would bring?

Yet the reason she hadn't died, couldn't die, was because…

\textit{Tomorrow will be alright. That's right.}

\textit{Maybe tomorrow, I can catch at least a rat with this. Maybe I can earn a silver from a kind passerby. If I can increase my attainment by one more level, maybe I can kill that head beggar.}

\textit{So, it'll be alright.}

\textit{I was never not afraid, but just as I've done well so far, I'll continue to do well in the future.}

Qing raised her hand.

She was still scared and trembling, but still, she felt like she could somehow manage. Because she felt like she could do it.

Qing's hand came down.

The Moonlight Sword scattered a cold, blue moonlight.

A diagonal slash appeared on the massive barrier.

Craaaash, the sound of the world tilting. Slowly falling backwards, the immense barrier made the sound of a world collapsing, as it raised dust that filled the space between heaven and earth.

It gradually settled, revealing what was beyond.

\textit{Huh? There's nothing there. It was no big deal.}

Qing smiled beautifully.

\begin{center}
	$\ast$~$\ast$~$\ast$
\end{center}

Ximen Surin jumped up from her seat.

\textit{Like this? So suddenly?}

Masters in the special seats all stood up, anxiously watching a young martial artist finally break its shell.

The faint starlight revealed for the first time in the world, a moment when a martial artist used their Imagery to create a complete moment that shone by itself.

The spectators held their breath.

They did not know much about martial arts, but they knew that something extraordinary was happening at this very moment.

Because it was the birth of a star, the moment a new star took its place in the vast universe, emitting its color for the first time.

Thus, the newborn star cried out for the first time.

Suddenly, the spectators gasped, simultaneously expelling the air from their lungs.

All that remained was the sword.

It was clearly a woman holding a sword, but when they looked at the woman, the sword was not visible, and when they looked at the sword, the woman disappeared. As such, the distinction between the two was lost, creating the image of a swordsman who held a sword, complete with a person and a sword as one.

A person was a sword, and a sword was a person, dancing.

In Qing's dantian, the True Qis collided, squashed, and crushed each other, causing a riot as they all tried to get out first.

At the moment of the first starlight, whether it was the Qi of a Daoist or the Demonic Qi of a Demonic Art, it was a declaration of existence that could never be missed. Thus, all the True Qi was released at once.

Gently swaying, the slow sword was surrounded by Sword Forces of various colors; the warm yellow of the setting sun, the hopeful green of spring, the tenacious resentment that was entirely black, the coldly white and chilly frost. And the utterly obscene red. The five cardinal colors, the foundation of all colors, represented all the colors under heaven.

Thousands upon thousands of Sword Forces scattered like flower petals, flowing while fluttering, mingling and playing with each other, swirling and surging, brilliantly illuminating all around in a dance of colors.

It was a breathtaking sight that one wished would last forever, or at least hoped it would.

But beauty is always fleeting, eventually withering and fading away.

The colors that filled the sky disappeared.

Ahhh, a sigh of regret burst forth from everyone at the same time, filling the world with sorrow.

And in the center of it all, Qing opened her eyes.

"Phew. Well, that wasn't much."

"Young Lady Ximen? Just now, what exactly, what……"

Gongson Yeyeh's voice trembled with excitement.

She couldn't believe what she had just seen with her own eyes.

"That just now, that, what was that martial art?"

Hastily urging Gongson Yeyeh to speak, Qing just tilted her head.

"Huh? Did I do something? Sorry, I was just standing there absentmindedly, wasn't I? But I've broken through the wall now. Now this body, this Transcendent Qing, shall be called Transcen-Qing! So let's try agai-"

Qing staggered and sat down.

Just like when she finished her training of the Nine Yin Manual's Tendon Changing and Marrow Cleansing, all her muscles screamed in unison, 'This is the limit, just kill me already', thus staging a simultaneous strike.

"Uh, uh?"

Qing tried to forcefully circulate her Qi and stand up, but she was startled by the emptiness of her dantian. It was completely empty, without even a wisp of True Qi, not even the slightest breath of Inner Qi.

It was the first time Qing had ever emptied her dantian to this extent, so she couldn't help but be bewildered.

All that remained was the firmly stuck, unyielding, rock-like HeavenShattering Demonic Qi. It was as good as nothing since she couldn't use it anyway. Moreover, even the very tiny portion that had been moving had disappeared.

\textit{What? Does reaching the Transcendent Realm reset your resources?}

\textit{It doesn't give more resources, it just empties them?}

"Um. So. I don't think I can continue with the duel. Sorry. I was getting excited, but I think I need to step out now. Um, referee-"

Just as Qing was about to call the referee to declare her defeat…

Rumble, the elevated dueling platform shook and swayed, then collapsed with a crash.

Splash, Qing fell into the waters of the Grand Canal.

Fortunately, there were broken pieces of wood of various sizes floating around, so Qing was about to grab a sturdy one when-

'No you don't! 'It felt like all of Qing's muscles were screaming at her. After performing a feat that far surpassed her realm, her entire body was subjected to an overuse akin to torture.

Qing's muscles expressed their resentment towards their owner through one of the world's most agonizing pains: cramps.

"Ack! Cramp! Cramp! Ugh, eugh, gulp, cramp! Help!"

Not just her arms and legs, but also her shoulders, back muscles, and even her neck muscles were spasming, expressing their resentment.

\textit{Even my jaw muscles, wait, why does my jaw have a cramp?!}

Although Qing didn't know, it was actually quite common for the jaw to cramp. It could happen occasionally when one ate too enthusiastically.

The part that Qing should have been surprised about was not her jaw muscles, but her abdominal muscles. It was really rare for the rectus abdominis to cramp.

"Eugh, puff, gulp, pahat, cough, keugh."

Her jaw muscles spasming, Qing couldn't even scream properly and gulped down water. Then, water entered her nose, making her airways burn, and she lost her mind. 

\textit{Help, someone save me…}

As Qing's consciousness faded, she thought she saw her master's face.

It was a grand and miserable end to the duel competition.

\begin{center}
	$\ast$~$\ast$~$\ast$
\end{center}

Originally, after the duel competition, the winner and runner-up were supposed to greet each other.

However, thanks to Qing's swift demolition of the elevated dueling platform, that sequence was skipped.

As a side note, the members of the Wulin Alliance's steering committee truly screamed in despair.

First, the members of the military division, who had to replan the entire schedule from scratch and control the people, screamed.

And the finance department, which had planned to dismantle the elevated dueling platform carefully to sell the wood, could not even scream at the cosmic horror they faced.

"Uh, me? Did I do that?"

Qing blinked her eyes.

\textit{Syncretism? I combined with a sword?}

\textit{Is that even possible?}

\textit{How can a person combine with a sword?}

Seeing 'that expression', Ximen Surin became dejected.

\textit{This girl is hopeless.}

\textit{It seems she just unleashed what was within her in a moment of unconsciousness.}

\textit{Still, even if she doesn't remember, she displayed it with her body, so it was a great fortune.}

\textit{And she had achieved the Transcendent Realm, so she was indeed a commendable disciple.}

With this, the record for the youngest to reach the Transcendent Realm was also broken.

The female martial artist, Ximen Qing, achieved this when she was exactly… twenty years old, forever immortalized in the history of Wulin!

Fortunately, Qing's misbehavior was not recorded.

The youngest winner of the Hidden Dragon Sparring Competition, the first female martial artist to win, as well as the youngest to reach the Transcendent Realm, simultaneously broke the records for all three achievements. However, it was followed by the absurdity of immediately falling into the water due to a full-body muscle rebellion and almost drowning.

Fortunately, Ximen Surin, who had been watching Qing's condition closely, immediately flew in on her sword, skillfully retrieving her disciple with the precision targeting of a nuclear weapon, thus preventing the most tragic event in the history of Wulin.

If it wasn't for that, people would be talking about how it was a shame the Divine Maiden Sect's disciple drowned to death, thus preventing the birth of a second Celestial Martial Emperor, or a Celestial Martial Empress. These kinds of completely meaningless what-ifs regarding historical events would have been discussed for ages.
