PART 90 One Lucky Day

Reference to 1924's Korean short story 'One Lucky Day'

CHAPTER 901




CHAPTER 902

Swinging a sword on horseback certainly has a unique and unparalleled thrill.

If I had to compare it's less like slicing and more like tearing—raw and visceral. Hmm nice.

"Eek s-spare me…! Gah!"

But why?

Qing falls into thought.

With the horse's speed and the added momentum from the high vantage point shouldn't the cuts be smoother?

Yet why does it feel rougher with muscles and skin catching bones shattering and that ecstatic destruction reverberating violently through my grip wrist forearm and elbow? Wow how do I even describe this?

"Split! You go that way!"

"Aaaah!"

"Waaah! Someone help!"

The Moonlight Sword raised high descends vertically onto the bandit's skull like an axe lodged in firewood.

Normally it would cleave through the spine and exit the back but this time it stopped at the neckbone and stuck.

Suddenly a lightbulb goes off in Qing's head.

Ah I see.

"Why why are you only chasing me…!"

The Moonlight Sword arcs upward in a diagonal trajectory.

The Sword Qi forms a long ribbon-like trail stretching like unfurled silk before meeting the bandit.

The blade slips in silently and smoothly.

Even after the sword passes through the bandit takes two more steps before his upper body slides off and plops to the ground.

Hmm. That makes sense.

Whether it's a sword or a saber the essence lies in the act of slicing.

Think of radishes—when a man draws his sword he must slice.

To slice a radish the knife must move outward or inward; there must be motion.

If you press the blunt edge down instead?

That's not slicing—it's crushing or chopping.

Swordplay and saber techniques are ultimately about slicing efficiently.

Thus they're refined arts designed to maximize lethality through footwork and technique.

But on horseback the high vantage point and simplified movements turn every swing into an axe-like strike.

Naturally the sensation is rougher.

Perhaps mounted martial arts are techniques optimized for this very motion.

"Gah gack…!"

Did the creators of these martial arts meticulously account for such details?

Modifying martial arts isn't easy…

Lost in thought Qing tugs the reins.

The clever Lu Bu understands and slows to match the fleeing bandit's pace.

About half an hour later.

"Huff huff…! I—I can't… anymore… Just kill me! Kill me!"

The man running ahead of Lu Bu finally collapses gasping for air.

Sprinting for half an hour is commendable but he's clearly hit his limit.

"You want to die? Fine. Request accepted."

"Huff… N-no wait spare me…!"

"You want to live? That's also accepted."

"Huh? You'll spare me?"

"I'll count to five. If I catch you you die. If you escape you live. Ready? One two—"

"Damn it!"

The man scrambles up and runs again.

But his pace isn't the same.

To run long distances you must conserve energy but pausing even briefly loosens the muscles sapping strength.

Yet he runs anyway.

His desperate sprint looks like someone's threatening him with a blade.

Because Qing is literally threatening him with a blade.

And eventually—

"Gah! Aaagh…!"

The man suddenly collapses clutching his calf and writhing in agony.

Either a cramp from overexertion or a torn tendon.

"Tsk. Guess you don't want to live? Should I count to five again? One two three…"

"Aaaah!"

But numbers mean nothing now. Pain a pounding heart suffocating lungs—the bandit hears nothing.

"…Four. Five."

Well no choice. A promise is a promise. Ah what a hassle. For the sake of the world I'll have to dispose of this useless beast.

A man's word must be kept.

A moment later.

Qing stretches her smile brighter than ever behind her mask.

"Ahh refreshing. Bandits first thing in the morning? Is today my lucky day? Feels like it."

This is the joy of solo travel.

With friends around bandits don't dare approach.

When luck's on your side everything goes right.

Qing's good fortune didn't end with the morning bandits.

She got lucky again.

After a satisfying morning she felt peckish.

While chewing on jerky an inn materialized out of nowhere by the roadside.

Not unusual—inns often pop up along busy roads. In this primitive society a roof over your head beats the dangers of the wild.

But appearing just when she was hungry? A delightful coincidence.

Of course such inns tend to be pricey but Qing's wallet was comfortably heavy.

"Waiter! Bring your best dishes quick. Three plates."

"Right away!"

And the food was delicious!

The pork was a bit tough but the spicy marinade made up for it tempting her to order rice.

The unnamed fish stew wasn't entirely free of fishy odors but the fiery spices masked it well.

The spicy dumplings were a delicacy even Sichuan couldn't match and the noodles had that throat-scratching kick rare in the Zhongyuan.

The stir-fried greens were wilted but addictive making her shovel them in nonstop.

Spicy flavors are truly overpowered.

When ingredients are subpar or the cook's skills lacking nothing hides flaws better than spice.

Given the remote location freshness was an issue but the cook's ingenuity shone through.

…Or so she thought!

How much poison did these bastards dump in here?

It tasted good though.

A paralytic? Or a sedative?

Sure enough the kitchen staff kept sneaking glances her way.

To oblige Qing slammed her head onto the table.

"Heh finally kicking in? Thought you'd never drop. That horse of yours had us worried."

"Worried huh? Sell the horse and skip town then. But damn you're tough. We emptied our poison stash and you still ate it all…"

"Must be a martial arts master."

"Master or not that much arsenic would kill even the world's best. Let's bury her and scram."

"First let's see her face. Just to be sure."

Hah of course.

In the Zhongyuan innkeepers rank among the lowest professions ripe for turning into traffickers bandits or worse.

In a remote place like this who'd know what happened?

Head on the table Qing's limp arm suddenly shoots out seizing the waiter's throat.

"Gack."

"Wow today's really my day huh?"

Qing's lips curl into a grin.

A refreshing morning an unexpectedly delicious lunch and now post-meal exercise?

Unbelievable.

Her luck didn't stop there.

After dismantling the inn's staff-turned-bandits and resuming her journey an arrow thuds into the ground ahead blocking her path.

A classic bandit ambush.

Wow three rounds in one day!

Morning slaughter post-lunch slaughter and now another!

But wait there's more.

At dusk she arrives at Musun County and orders a feast at an inn.

"You the owner of that black horse?"

"And you are?"

"I am Yi Taeryeong."

A rule of thumb in the martial world:

When someone proudly announces their name in public count to three.

One two—

"Yi Taeryeong!" "The Twin Killers of Baek Mountain!" "Oh no!"

The Twin Killers of Baek Mountain.

By the sacred laws of martial aliases this roughly translates to:

Baek Mountain's.

Twin.

Killers.

Clearly horse bandit scum.

And if your alias includes "killer" you're the kind of scum who deserves death without question.

"The weak who hoard treasures invite disaster. I'm here to help you."

Qing's grin widens.

What? Is it my birthday or something?

Why's today so wild? A lucky day? And no one's even brought me soup.

A short while later.

The infamous Twin Killers of Baek Mountain ceased to exist.

Thanks to the warm-up dinner was delicious—went down smooth.

Just as the day seemed to wind down—

While buying snacks a sneaky hand reaches for her wallet.

Qing grabs the wrist and studies the face then scans the head.

Why check the face? Pickpockets are often minors and kids get a pass.

But this one's old enough.

A life of sin a beast in human skin—qualified.

Crack. The sound of breaking bone.

"Aaaah!"

Crunch. The sound of grinding bone.

"Grrk…!"

The pickpocket collapses foaming at the mouth.

Couldn't handle the pain of bones shattering alive. Pathetic.

Qing hums cheerfully as she strolls through the market.

Wow what's up with today? Nonstop fun.

Is this my reward for being good?

Honestly I wish every day was like this.

Come to think of it Lu Bu's a real lucky charm.

Aside from the pickpocket all today's villains—no beasts—were thanks to him.

Qing's steps are light as air.

—-

Musun County Yaobin Inn.

The Yaobin Tower Murong Juhui mentioned was Musun's landmark.

And in the Zhongyuan naming your establishment after a landmark requires prestige.

Thus the Yaobin Inn's name alone declares its status as Musun's finest.

And Qing a filthy-rich capitalist always books the best room at the best inn.

Naturally she stayed at the Yaobin Inn.

And so did someone else.

"Sword Demon? I've never seen anyone eat like this. The world is vast indeed."

"Do you have a bottomless pit in there? Unbelievable."

The Looting Demon couldn't take his eyes off Qing's meal.

In this primitive era the concept of mukbang was too much for his dull bored mind to handle."


CHAPTER 903

"Qing's mood as she set off toward Mount Baekdu after breakfast at the inn was as lively and cheerful as ever.

Because the streak of good luck that had followed her all day yesterday seemed poised to continue today.

Look there are already people tailing me.

Another round of fun right from the morning huh?

Sure enough Qing's sharp senses picked up a group of suspicious figures following her.

After all ordinary travelers or merchants wouldn't have any reason to trail her like this.

If they were friendly they'd have caught up and said something like "How far are you going? Want to travel together? We'll treat you to a meal!"—that would've been the natural approach.

So the fact that they were keeping their distance and following her meant they definitely didn't have good intentions.

Qing patted Lu Bu's neck affectionately.

What a clever boy. Just by existing he's like a walking provocation luring bandits out of the woodwork.

About half an hour after leaving Musun County a large lake stretched out to their right.

It was called Jeongwol Lake frozen solid in the bitter cold of Liaoning casting a desolate yet serene landscape.

Following the frozen lakeshore they eventually reached a fork in the road—one path leading toward Manchuria and the other toward Hwanin County.

Oh looks like the bandits decided to make their move here.

Qing smiled faintly as she spotted a figure standing motionless at the fork.

They were far enough from the city—about half an hour's ride—to be in a secluded mountain path.

If they went any farther the bandits would have too long a journey back home after their business.

So this was the perfect spot for them to reveal their true colors.

Suppressing her excitement Qing slowed her horse's pace and approached leisurely.

The figure at the fork was a man and a woman.

The woman was unremarkable but the man was quite striking.

He carried multiple swords on his waist and long spear shafts protruded from his back giving the impression of a walking arsenal.

Quite the show-off.

But then again why bother lugging around so many weapons?

If you weren't picky you could just grab whatever was handy—no need to carry them all at once.

Mastering even one weapon was hard enough; trying to master several would only dilute your skill.

Still judging by his appearance his alias was probably something like "Ten Weapons Ghost."

Depending on his level it might evolve into "Hundred Weapons Ghost" or even "Ten Thousand Weapons Ghost" if he ever made a name for himself.

Qing was brimming with confidence.

Here I am casually analyzing my opponent like I've got all the time in the world.

But why wouldn't she be confident?

She was a master of the Flower Realm—no not just any master but a transcendent one bordering on the Profound Realm (not really).

Against a Flower Realm opponent she had nothing to worry about.

It's not like a Profound Realm expert would just pop up out of nowhere right?

Qing suppressed the killing intent threatening to spill out.

Morning slaughter! A strong invigorating start to the day!

Strength calls for blood!

And I'm feeling pumped!

With a spring in her step Qing approached the pair.

When she stopped in front of them she couldn't help but wonder what nonsense they'd spout this time.

What'll it be? The usual "spare me" spiel? Or maybe "my leg hurts your horse looks nice"? Or will they surprise me with something creative?

And indeed what came next was completely unexpected.

"The Heavenly Flower Sword is it?"

Qing froze. They're looking for me?

"…Who are you?"

"No need to be so wary. A Flower Realm master hiding her face carrying a big sword—three heads ahem my apologies that's no way to speak to a lady. So I just assumed you must be the Heavenly Flower Sword."

"Gasp!"

That wasn't Qing.

The woman beside the man who had been standing there blankly suddenly gasped in shock.

"The Heavenly Flower Sword? Are you really the Heavenly Flower Sword? Wow I never thought I'd see the real thing. This is amazing."

She bowed deeply.

"I'm Gong Ryang Sayun. I saw your hearty meal—very impressive. I pride myself on my appetite but seeing you I realize there's always someone better. Please call me Sayun fellow disciple of the culinary path."

Ignoring the woman's reaction Qing's heart sank.

They didn't recognize me as Ximen Qing first—they pegged me as a Flower Realm master.

Meaning they could tell my cultivation level at a glance.

But how?

I didn't even reveal my mental imagery yesterday—just sword flux. So how did they know I'm in the Flower Realm?

Unless…

"Are you… a Profound Realm master?"

Qing had always followed the principle of "bow to the strong dominate the weak."

A true opportunist through and through!

So her attitude instantly became deferential.

"I am in the Profound Realm but I wouldn't call myself a master."

Join our discord and ping me to update more chapters. Discord: https://discord.gg/93rmBjgP6B
What kind of nonsense is that?

If a Profound Realm expert isn't a master then who is?

That's like a CEO saying "I'm a CEO but I'm not rich."

"I reached the Profound Realm over ten years ago. And in all that time I haven't advanced an inch. How could I call myself a master?"

"Ah I see."

"Sometimes I wonder if I'm even in the Profound Realm at all. Maybe I'm stuck in some limbo. Breaking through to the next stage is several times harder than reaching the Profound Realm in the first place."

Suddenly the mood turned into a pity party.

Qing still cowering internally listened quietly to his lament.

"I thought the same. Breaking into the Profound Realm felt too easy. But once I got here I couldn't move forward at all."

Well isn't that normal?

Even within the same realm there are early middle and late stages but the gap in the Profound Realm is so vast that such classifications become meaningless.

Her master had once told her that advancing even a single step in the Profound Realm was harder than all the training that came before it.

"So after much deliberation I concluded that I should collect as many martial arts as possible. That's why I've been traveling to learn them."

Qing gulped.

That's… a weird conclusion. Or rather the conclusion isn't weird but the execution is questionable.

"Um when you say you've been traveling to learn martial arts… do you mean what I think you mean? Most martial artists won't teach outsiders. Especially those from sects—they'd rather die than leak their techniques."

"I thought they were just bluffing but surprisingly they really chose death. Even when I promised to let them go if they taught me they refused. That's how I earned my alias—the Looting Demon."

Qing's expression darkened.

Damn it.

I thought he was just a horse thief but he's a martial arts thief.

And a Profound Realm one at that.

What kind of Profound Realm expert goes around robbing people?

Running into a Profound Realm master on the road is ridiculous!

Qing felt wronged.

Profound Realm experts aren't the kind of people you just bump into!

There are only nine officially recognized Profound Realm masters in the martial world—though unofficially there might be more.

But still in all of the Zhongyuan only nine confirmed Profound Realm masters exist. Meeting one in the wild is practically a once-in-a-lifetime event.

Sure she'd encountered one at the imperial palace but that was the palace—it made sense for a Profound Realm expert to be there.

But here on a random mountain path a Profound Realm master pops up demanding martial arts?

Unthinkable.

And yet it was happening.

"I have other names but for now I'm the Looting Demon. And you're looking at him."

And who was Qing?

A martial arts thief who stole techniques through her mysterious Status Window leaving her victims none the wiser.

A phantom thief of martial arts—practically a candidate for the Divine Thief title herself.

So this was a dramatic encounter between a martial arts thief and a martial arts robber.

Perhaps it was fate.

"Don't take it too badly. I'm desperate too. I do have some shame so I'm giving you a fair chance to fight back. Consider it payment for your martial arts—though that's not quite the right word. But sparring with a Profound Realm master is a valuable experience isn't it?"

If he had any shame he wouldn't be robbing people of their martial arts in the first place.

Still it was true that fighting a Profound Realm master was an invaluable opportunity.

Especially since she could go all out—fighting for her life for her martial arts.

The last shred of the Looting Demon's conscience worn down to a faint triangular trace.

Not that it made him any less shameless.

Who in their right mind would betray their sect and master just to survive?

So Qing put on a solemn expression—

Hmm which martial art should I hand over?

The Moon Maiden Sword Art? Too obvious. The Yin Jade Maiden Divine Art that turns men into women? Hmm but I'd need permission from the Seol Clan for that.

Then again the Seol Clan wouldn't care—they wiped out their enemies' sects themselves.

But provoking a Profound Realm master's grudge might not be wise…

As Qing hesitated the Looting Demon grew impatient.

"Come on what's the point of stalling? How do you want to fight? Sword? Spear? Saber? Halberd? Staff? You use a sword so I could match you with one. Or you could pick a weapon you've never fought before. Your choice. What'll it be?"

That last part caught her attention.

Qing quickly replied "Then how about fists?"

The Looting Demon's eyebrows twitched.

"Are you shameless? Fists? I've never even learned such a crude skill. Who'd fight barehanded when they have weapons?"

"But you said I could choose anything."

"I said choose a weapon. If you wanted to fight barehanded why would I bother carrying all this?"

"But fist techniques are the purest form of martial study the most fundamental—"

"Enough nonsense. You just picked fists because you think it's the easiest option."

Qing grumbled internally.

Damn that didn't work."


CHAPTER 904

Qing examined the Looting Demon's weapons.

First she excluded long weapons like spears staves and halberds.

In combat the advantage of reach was undeniable—expressed in her homeland's terms as "range superiority."

If two fighters were equally skilled the one with the longer weapon would win eight or nine times out of ten. In the Zhongyuan they called this "ten out of nine" a foregone conclusion.

Of course in the martial world it wasn't that absolute.

Assuming both fighters had equal skill experience and adaptability the one with the longer weapon would still have a slight edge.

Martial artists had techniques to overcome the disadvantage of reach using internal energy.

But the gap between the Flower Realm and the Profound Realm was like heaven and earth. And now a Profound Realm opponent had the advantage of reach with a long weapon?

This is dirty. Really.

Qing's gaze shifted to the weapons at the Looting Demon's waist.

One sword and three sabers—a straight saber a guidou saber and a langya saber.

A saber was generally easier to handle than a sword.

And at the Profound Realm the weight of the weapon wouldn't matter—they could deliver crushing blows regardless. A lighter straight saber might even be harder to counter.

Between the guidou and langya sabers the guidou—a more conventional saber—was the better choice.

The langya saber had jagged edges like a saw a vicious weapon that could tear flesh with the slightest graze.

Even if she held back a fight to the death could easily turn into a bloodbath.

"Uh then the guidou saber."

"Good choice. It's also my personal favorite."

Qing's mind sharpened.

"Wait when you say ‘personal favorite' does that mean you usually use a saber—specifically a guidou saber?"

"Indeed. Whether it's because the martial art I mastered is saber-based or because my temperament suits the guidou saber it's the one that feels most natural in my hand."

Damn wrong choice.

Of all the weapons she had to pick the one he specialized in. Trying to outthink him had backfired.

"Uh this might sound petty but can I change my choice? Swords! I'm a swordswoman—how about a sword duel?"

"Too late. For some reason everyone picks the guidou saber when given the choice."

The Looting Demon grinned savagely.

Qing realized she'd been played.

The weapons he carried weren't just for show.

They were all harder to counter than the guidou saber ensuring most opponents would pick it.

A Profound Realm master resorting to such a cheap trick…!

But then again fools rarely reached such profound heights.

Or perhaps he was so simple-minded that he approached martial arts in a completely different way.

The Looting Demon untied his weapons and tossed them aside keeping only the guidou saber.

He gestured at Qing.

"Come at me."

Talking just made things worse…

No—if she could kill him she should.

Qing steeled herself recalling the Looting Demon's sins.

His demeanor was calm and unassuming but his sins were anything but.

With over 500 points of evil karma how many people had he killed just to steal their martial arts?

A Profound Realm master who hid his strength and preyed on others was no honorable figure.

Qing raised Moonlight Sword high.

She inhaled sharply gripping her dantian fiercely.

Energy surged violently through her meridians.

Suddenly the world tilted.

The world leaned toward Qing as if drawn by her gravitational pull.

A sword that stood alone between heaven and earth—the first stance of the Solitary Sword: Solitary Existence.

Where her sword pointed became the axis of the universe.

Qing had no reason to hold back against a Profound Realm opponent.

Gong Ryang Sayun leaped back in shock.

The Solitary Sword embodied a worldview where only the self existed—a violent philosophy that distorted reality.

The world tilted and the swordsman vanished behind the sword's presence leaving only a single blade standing tall.

The Looting Demon's relaxed expression shattered. His lips twisted and his jaw clenched.

His guidou saber glowed crimson with enhanced qi.

A Profound Realm's qi wasn't just starlight—it was blinding brilliance.

The sword and saber closed in—

Clang!

The guidou saber was knocked back violently.

The Looting Demon's arms flew up as if cheering his head tilting toward the sword's radiant qi as if about to split in two.

Then—

The guidou saber struck again.

Countless afterimages followed.

No not afterimages.

Each was a real strike like a thousand bells ringing at once—clang-clang-clang!

Qing gritted her teeth.

Dozens of impacts rattled her sword sending shocks through her palms until they burned.

The Looting Demon's relentless assault targeted a single point—the sword's tip.

He struck thousands tens of thousands of times refusing to stop until he shattered her defense.

Qing marveled at his sheer determination.

Hundred-Tempered Saber Art First Stance: Dripping Water Pierces Stone.

A training art emphasizing endless repetition over combat prowess.

Its first stance embodied perseverance—like water droplets wearing through rock.

But the Solitary Sword was different.

It was a perfected art standing atop the heavens looking down on all below.

Its first stance was a declaration of perfection.

And now a human saber was hammering at it.

A hundred strikes a thousand perhaps ten thousand.

Then—

Crack!

The world tilted by Qing's sword shattered.

The ground returned below the sky above—only Qing was sent skidding back her feet scraping the earth.

She swallowed the rising heat in her throat.

Her internal energy had been drained by a third and her meridians were in turmoil.

The metallic tang of blood filled her mouth but her eyes burned with fighting spirit.

A Profound Realm opponent is no joke.

But it was worth a try.

The endless repetition was terrifying but it revealed his martial art.

At best it was a blue-grade technique—crude and basic likely an entry-level saber art.

No finesse just the most fundamental stances executed flawlessly—hundreds of times in a single breath.

Simple yet effective.

Qing stomped her right foot—

Black Heavenly Horse's Step exploded forward scattering remnants of demonic energy.

Her sword traced countless afterimages—

Ten Thousand and One Strikes of the Asura Sword.

A beastly flurry of slashes.

The Looting Demon's afterimages multiplied in response.

Vertical cuts horizontal slashes diagonal strikes—the four basic saber stances overlapped infinitely.

The clashing of steel was relentless.

Like a thousand blacksmiths hammering at once sparks of qi flying everywhere.

Suddenly Qing's sword shifted.

The aggressive thrusts transformed into elegant wave-like motions—

Moon Maiden Sword Art Eighth Stance: Moonlight Without Regret.

Three streams of qi surged like tides yet the maiden wielding the sword remained indifferent.

Qing saw her—the Moon Maiden.

A woman who lost her beloved in war.

Alone in the world she had been just a nameless child—neither male nor female not even human.

Meeting a man made her the Moon Maiden a woman a person.

Because of you I exist.

Conversely before meeting him she had been nature itself—the entirety of the world.

So she returned to the mountains becoming nothing again.

Rejecting bonds she remained unchanging.

What kind of depressing martial arts are these?

The Solitary Sword tells you to abandon everything and train until you die.

The Moon Maiden Sword says perfection lies in never meeting anyone.

Why so negative?

If you abandon everything what's the point of becoming a master?

Avoiding sadness by avoiding love is like refusing to eat because you'll get hungry again.

Moon Maiden why the cynicism?

For a moment Qing's sword wavered.

A swordsman doubting their own technique creates a disconnect.

And a Profound Realm master wouldn't miss such an opening.

"Wait hold on—!"

If Qing had been on the offensive before now she was desperately defending against the Looting Demon's relentless strikes.

Offense and defense reversed!


CHAPTER 905

Hyun-kyung's skills are nothing to be surprised about since the opponent is Hyun-kyung, so if Hyun-kyung shows power as strong as Hyun-kyung, why would anyone be surprised?

However, the sight of Qing, who kept retreating but still managed to ward off the countless shadows of the countless swarms of savages, was truly a remarkable feat.

The expression "transcendental landscape" that Qing himself jokingly uses is truly worthy of recognition.

But Qing's expression gradually becomes more and more rotten.

Are you on the defensive against Hyun-kyung?

What kind of reaction should Qing show, and what kind of reaction has Qing shown so far?

After escaping through the Nungpa Mibo, he was busy running around like a rat with its tail on fire, running around aimlessly.

But somehow, Qing is fighting back.

Why?

Well, that's because the robber was watching.

The robber has no intention of killing Qing because his goal is Qing's martial arts.

I heard that the other leaders of the sect are burning with resentment, shouting, "Kyaaaaak! We will kill Seomun-Qing at all costs! We will kill him unconditionally!"

That's their business, not the robber's business.

Rather than killing him?

If you cause serious injury or permanent damage, you'll be even more cautious, as if you were going to throw yourself into a rage, saying, "You did this to me and still give me martial arts skills? Just kill me, full stomach!"

Since it is the law that the person who is sorry should be the one who leaves, wouldn't the person who is sorry now be the robber?

Qingdo was well aware of that fact.

So, the enemy can't use his weapons on me, but I can use them freely.

This calculation was also behind the extremely vile Cheonsalseong's willing acceptance of these conditions.

however?

Qing's expression gradually becomes more and more rotten.

This makes you angry?

It was an unavoidable attribute of being unmanned.

Now that he had tasted some of the martial arts world, he started to think like a martial artist.

While I was rushing at him with the intention of killing him, the other person responded calmly as if they were doing some kind of work, as if telling me to keep going until I was exhausted, so of course I couldn't help but get angry.

Kkwarung!

At the master's wrath, the bicycle rider willingly rises and unleashes purple lightning.

The lightning strikes too late after the sound is heard, and the bicycle strikes the robber's shoulder.

Although it wasn't enough to break through Hyun-kyung's defensive skills, it was enough to create a brief, fleeting opening.

Qing, who was taking a step back, suddenly puts his weight on his hind legs and stomps his front legs in reverse.

At the same time, the Moonlight Sword draws a diagonal line.

The most perfect straight line connecting the enemy and me.

Emperor's sword type.

The emperor simply sits on a high place, points at the enemy, and annihilates them. The one who moves the world with his simple fingertips is the emperor.

In an instant, the new form of the robber splits into two.

One remained in his position and was cut by the Moonlight Sword, while the other stepped back and stood with some distance between them.

It was a technique called Lee Hyeong-hwan-wi, which was a phenomenon in which an afterimage was left behind by moving quickly in an instant.

The robber suddenly felt refreshed.

The hem of his clothes was torn and the cold air of early spring in Liaoning touched his skin.

But a smile appears on the robber's lips.

Just now, it was a move that almost put even himself in danger.

Overwhelming majesty unfolds in a single thought!

A perfect move that combines attack and defense, cutting off the flow with a single stroke and dominating the situation!

It must have been a very solemn and solemn season.

The robber couldn't stand it anymore and shouted!

"Good!"

"Bullshit!"

An angry shout in response.

But it's a sound I hear from up in the sky.

When the robber lifted his head, he saw a blue figure crouching upside down in the air.

Soon, the blue rained down on the ground like shells, with the force of a star falling.

The great and mighty Gyeongcheon Daeseongmagon, the great and mighty Yu Seongrak.

Boom! A huge roar, the frozen ground shatters, and a cloud of dust rises.

And then, breaking through the dust, a robber horse with a long sword in front of him slides out behind Ji-ik in the same posture.

Then, the new Qing type pursues him.

With the upper body forward while floating in the air, the right hand holding the sword is pulled completely behind the left shoulder.

The Moonlight Sword is covered in a sunset glow, and a fiery red thunderbolt swirls around it, roaring. The moment he extends the sword and brings it down, a single red thunderbolt connecting the sky and the earth roughly strikes down.

Blood heat electroencephalography, blood brain dragon bankruptcy.

The robber lifts the blade of the sword of the Gwandudo with his left hand and raises it in a flash.

Immediately after the collision, a power struggle between the two begins, as if Qing, who was swinging his Moonlight Sword, was frozen in mid-air.

However, the blade of the Moonlight Sword is slowly being pushed back.

At that moment, beyond the blue cotton cloth, three blue flowers bloomed in the pupils and began to rotate.

At the same time, countless waves of energy surged from the blade of the Moonlight Sword, which then began to rotate violently.

The ten greatest magicians in the world, the wheel-wheeled demonic kalpa!

In both density and power, there is a significant difference in the strength of the Hwagyeong and Hyeongyeong.

But despite that, the Qing and Hwagyeong's energy slowly begins to penetrate the glans and into the Kangtalma's energy.

The startled robber turns the wheel.

The new blue version of him lands surprisingly gracefully, despite having been struggling with his strength just a moment ago.

Then, the image of a giant hand, infinitely white and pure, yet at the same time distorted and hideous, fills the field of vision.

"Minority Demon Lord!"

After the robber shouted, it was only then that I realized that the strange energy just now was not a wheel-turning magic attack, so the purple lightning strike technique before that was a wheel-turning magic attack?

Qing takes advantage of the momentum and pushes even harder.

As the bell rings, the Tathagata Goddess's sword unfolds, and at the same time, he flies and extends his sword.

Sometimes, when I extend my fist, gripping my sword, I strike with a devastating blow that no longer exists, and the strange swordsmanship that glides past the enemy's blade and passes through like a ghost is the epitome of Talmyeongdo.

All kinds of martial arts swirl around, each changing into a different thought.

When it rushes, it is like a rough, swirling wind, and when it mixes in with others, it is like a quiet forest in silence, and when it feels like killing intent is burning hot like a flame, it is also like a mountain, standing firm and unshaken.

This is what it means to be a storm of ever-changing winds and volcanoes.

Meanwhile, Gangtalma's subordinates were watching this shocking fight with rapture.

And a non-human corpse was also watching this fight with interest.

It wasn't just a spectacle, they were constantly moving their mouths, puffing and puffing, talking silently.

"Sister Yuhwa, you're fighting Cheonhwageom and Geomma here. If there's anyone you're curious about, could you connect me with them? I'll relay it to you in real time."

-Really? Are you Cheonhwageom?

-Wow, where are you? The Baekdu Mountains? Wow, it's far.

-Is she that beautiful? Have you seen it in person?

"Everyone, shut up," the master said. "Oh, this is going to be fun. So, what's going on? By the way, Yuhwa, are you imitating my voice right now? No, cancel that. Anyway."

So, Gongryangsa Yoon began to relay the details of the confrontation between Qing and Gangtalma to the sisters throughout the Zhongyuan.

Is this how the power that I have is leaked out without me even noticing?

'Oh, Cheonhwageom-nim is swinging his sword really fast, really fast. The sword horse is also fast, so the sound is really loud. Chaeng chaeng chaeng chaeng chaeng, it goes like this.'

'Oh, Cheonhwageom is being pushed back.'

"Oh, lightning just struck. That's amazing. Cheonhwageom-nim, he was just flying around and swinging his sword, and, wow, that huge palm of his hand slammed into Geomma. Oh, and then his swordsmanship, wow, that's fast. Really fast. Just, that, shashashasha, that's fast."

-Sa-yoon? Is that the best you can do?

- Sister Gongryang, are you calling that a description?

-Ugh! If this is what's going to happen, then why on earth did you say you'd tell me?! You're bragging about meeting Cheonhwageom right now!

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTMkcrTGg0T1l3bjVTSm95K1MxV1RwWWhmMDhjOFNXM2tndHo5dmRmT3FQcg

-The master says, "Oh my, Sayoon, is that really the best you can do?"

"Oh, I'll do my best. Oh, so, Cheonhwageom-nim jumped and swung his sword, and just now, three or four times? He was incredibly fast. Geomma kept blocking, but yes, he blocked well. This is a showdown that makes the ground shake and your heart race."

-No, who swings a sword slowly!

-Sister, are you doing this on purpose? How can a person's expressive power be this miserable?

"It's a misunderstanding. I simply relayed the scene I saw, without a single error. Please don't blame me for your poor imagination."

-Oww! What the hell are you looking at! Unnie Gongryang, explain yourself now! Explain yourself!

-The master took a deep breath and went for a walk with his dog.

-Oh, Chugu. I miss Chugu. Is he really that ugly? Just how ugly can he be? I like ugly dogs too.

Fortunately, it seemed that the Qing power did not leak out.

The condition of the robber was not good.

His clothes were rags, and his exposed skin was cracked and blood was running down it.

Compared to that, Qing was relatively clean, just covered in dirt.

Anyone who sees it would think that Qing won.

Miss, you lost.

Qing crumpled her face.

By conventional means, there is no way for Qing to defeat Hyeon-gyeong.

To be precise, if the enemy of the current situation is extremely angry and his eyes roll back, and he rushes in with a state of "I will kill you even if it means suffering losses to myself," then he has a chance of winning.

Then, how can we possibly end the life of the victim by giving up flesh and taking bones?

But what if Hyun-kyung's enemies remain calm and unperturbed?

There is no way for Qing to fight back.

I don't know if it's because it's around the time of the Qing Dynasty's Hwagyeong, and you can roughly see the path leading to Hyeon-gyeong, and if you can confirm exactly what kind of realm it is.

To Qing, Hwagyeong is still a vague unknown, just a monster existing in the human world.

"Is this it?"

"No, don't you even get angry on a human level? If you get beaten up by Ha-su, you'd be furious and lose face, and roll your eyes and say you'll kill me. How can you be so inhumane?"

"Why should I be angry with you? It's because I'm a bit of a sergeant, and this is what it is. It's my fault. There's no reason to blame you."

If it weren't for his evil deeds, he would have had the appearance of a truly peerless master, but since it was the words of a martial arts thief who went around stealing other people's martial arts, it wasn't particularly convincing.

"Rather, thanks to you, I have gained confidence, so I am happy and have no reason to be angry."

"Are you sure?"

Then, the robber's eyes became blazing.

"Yes. I'm certain my thoughts were correct. Even though you're a demon possessed, you possess the ability to subdue even the Hwagyeong's later stages. This is because you've mastered countless magical arts. Isn't this proof that my gathering of martial arts to break through the realm was the right course of action?"

The eyes of the robber who speaks like that flash with a desperate madness.

However, it was a madness that felt somehow familiar, a look that seemed familiar, and Qing thought about it for a moment before-

Ah, this is the same class as Geomwoo, a martial arts madman, a guy obsessed with martial arts. Of course, I can't win against a madman.

Qing immediately understood the unusual endurance of the robber.

By the way?

"Are you a mine?"

"So, you're saying you're not a Mine? You seem poised to gather all ten of the world's greatest magic arts. But I've already personally tested you and confirmed that your skill far surpasses even Hwagyeong's, so I'd say you're a true Mine among them. Of course, I understand that it might be embarrassing for a true Mine to have mastered magic arts."

"Miss, is the expression ‘daman' really a real thing?"

It seems like there was a serious misunderstanding.

There's no need to correct it, right?

And then the robber's eyes flashed.

"Now, it's your turn to keep your promise."

"Well, I don't remember making any promises. I do remember being threatened, though."

"Then, will you die?"

But the blue soon wrinkled.

"Do you know the Taeeumoknyeo Shingong? Just in case you don't know, I'll explain. It's a divine art that originated in a certain place in the North Sea. It's called Jin, Jja, Gyeop, Na, Seon, Ni, Da. In addition to its power, it has incredible beauty benefits—"

"What will I gain by learning the inner strength method? Shall I break through the accumulated enemy strength and learn something new?"

"oh."

Originally, I was planning to just call them and send them away, but thinking about it, that's true.

If it's a high-level martial artist of the same lineage who can be learned as is, then how many martial artists would learn it right away just because they have obtained a better method?

Unless it's the ronin who are hungry for divine power and the Qing who build up their internal energy through dishonest acts.

Qing checks the martial arts skills he has.

"Well, would you like to have the Japanese sword too? I got it after a nail-biting, nail-biting match with that Japanese swordsman, Chusangryu, lasting perhaps seven or eight days."

"No work."

"What about the Blue Sea Sword? That vast ocean—"

"I know that too."

"A circulating flow?"

"I already know."

"Hoechonchang?"

"It's not a bad spear technique."

Even though Qing kept calling out the blue border martial arts, the robber knew that much as if it was a given.

Well, if I had been a martial arts thief until I accumulated that evil karma, wouldn't I have been able to obtain at least the blue border martial arts?

Then it looks like I'll have to come up with a red border martial art.

"Is it by any chance a right to speak-"

"Martial arts are the best."

"Isn't Unga Kwon a famous martial art?"

"I know. It's a new skill, but if I wanted to learn it, I could have learned it a long time ago. But what's the point of learning martial arts anyway?"

"Huh? You were able to learn it? Well, since something went wrong, it could have leaked. Then what about the Taesan Bloodline?"

"I personally don't like the law. What kind of law is that for a man? Swinging a sword with iron claws on his hand is shameful and embarrassing."

"You're being picky, ma'am. Hmm."

And then what's left is, um.

Talmyeongdo, Gyeongcheondaeseongmagon, something like that?

However, the Kyungcheon Daeseongmagon was a miraculous technique that allowed him to change direction in the air, so it was too dangerous a martial art to hand over to Madu.

So, there is only one thing left.


CHAPTER 906

Talmyeongdobeop (脫命刀法).

As the name suggests, it was a martial art that had a strong influence of Jeongjong Taoism, as it was a method to escape from fate and overcome it.

At the same time, it was also the martial arts of Talmyeongdo Odaesan, who was ranked 6th among the top ten martial arts masters certified by the Murim Alliance.

For reference, Odaesan's nickname, Talmyeongdo (奪命刀), is written in a different Chinese character from his martial arts, meaning a swordsman who takes lives, or a murderer.

I think it's quite insulting for a nickname for a master of the highest level.

Because when you become a true master, you have the power to change nicknames you don't like with the edge of your sword.

But there is no particular noise, and he himself is said to have a nickname called Talmyeongdo.

It seems that he thinks that kind of vicious nickname is cool, as expected from the head of Sapa.

It was also a martial art that Qing acquired as spoils of war after beating the young master who had been the father of Hyeon-gyeong in the past.

But, that was okay back then.

Because it was anonymous back then.

In the end, it was ruined because of Eonyeong, but somehow it was possible to blame it on the blood cult.

But now it's different.

If I keep the secret method to myself and keep my mouth shut, that's fine, but if I tell others, problems can arise.

But, I still think that if you want to pass on martial arts, it would be better to pass on the Talmyeongdo method.

Since it was originally the martial arts of the great demon leader of Sapa, if the martial arts of the great murderer were to be passed on to another great demon leader and martial arts thief, it would make sense, right?

But I couldn't just let it go like this.

Let's say that later on, if a problem arises, a master of the level of Talmyeongdo goes wild and says that his martial arts skills have been leaked and looks for a robber.

When Talmyungdo goes to Gangpilma and asks about the source of Talmyungdo, wouldn't it be a bit awkward if he says, "Oh, that? Cheonhwageom taught you that? But your martial arts are good."

When such a problem arises, Master told me to pretend not to know and just ignore it.

Actually, that's okay.

Qingi spared no expense in unleashing all manner of vicious magic attacks on Gangpilma, including those from the ten greatest magic attacks in the world, because he could have just pretended not to know.

Even if a notorious martial arts thief were to claim that the Sacred Heavenly Sword of the Jeongpa collects magical powers, who would believe him?

The Sapa guys might believe it, but what does it matter whether the Sapa guys believe it or not?

Our political family members won't believe it.

But, Sapha could be trusted.

So, I guess we should change the name of the method of demystification to something other than the method of demystification.

However, the name of a martial art can be said to be the image and core idea that forms the basis of that martial art.

So, if you want to change it, you have to change it to a word that has the same image as the word 'talmyeong' and can be interpreted as such.

If the martial arts master was just some random master, I wouldn't know, but if he's a master of the real world, he'll easily notice the discrepancy between the martial arts name and the ideology.

At that, Qing's head suddenly turns around.

Let's see, the Talmyeong of the Talmyeongdo method was Talmyeong, meaning to break away from one's predetermined fate, the mortal fate of a person, and achieve one's true self.

Well, if you want to escape from fate, your true self, destiny, the life ordained by heaven, the shackles, the oppression, and also escape from there… …

While Qing was pondering, Kangtalma waited quietly with a rather satisfied expression.

The martial arts I've recited so far are rather common, so much so that even a local martial arts official can find variations on them.

But if you keep your mouth shut and think about it for a long time, it means that it is a martial art that is too valuable to pass up to the point where you have to think about it so much.

So, Kang-tal-ma was waiting with great anticipation for Qing's mouth to open.

The Qing's intention was to simply change the name of the martial arts and its preface and the name of the herb, but he was just racking his brain for no reason.

After a while, Qing suddenly extends his hand.

"Could I borrow your sword? The leaf-shaped sword would suit you best, but it would still be better to use it as a sword than as a sword."

"Oh, wait a minute. Hey guys, does anyone have any leaves? Give me one!"

Then, a man with his face covered by a black mask jumped out from the back mountainside, knelt on one knee, and offered his weapon respectfully with both hands.

Qing's eyes narrow at him.

Cover your face? Only those sneaky bastards who have to hide their faces from others go around with their faces covered. Look at that evil karma, he's such an asshole, but that's true for a guy who covers his face. If he was proud of himself, why would he hide it? He would have proudly gone around showing his face.

Qing (a cotton lover, a master of making cotton balls, always hiding his face) cursed inwardly.

Because Qing was weak and strong, I only cursed him inwardly.

There's nothing I can do, I'm in front of Hyeon-gyeong's master.

Qing slowly unfolds the method of demystification.

Because it is a martial art based on the principle of overpowering an opponent with force, the entire arm, from the shoulder to the fist, draws a powerful line.

Even in the midst of all this, the use of the wrist was key. The movement of instantly folding the wrist to bring the blade close to the arm and then raising it again to cut was the essence of the Talmyeongdo method.

From the opponent's perspective, it will feel like the enemy's blade suddenly passes through the weapon even though the weapon was raised to block it.

In front of Qing, who had shown off her cooking skills like that, Kangthalma had a very satisfied smile on his face.

"Indeed, it's incredibly profound. It must be a renowned divine skill. What's its name?"

Well, you don't know how to escape.

Before telling him the changed name, I opened it up and took a look just in case he knew about the secret method.

Qing responded to him in a strange way.

"It's called the Self-Initiative Act."

"Juche Independence Law!"

"Huh? Do you know the Juche Independence Law?"

"No, I've never heard of it. But after hearing it, my heart feels somehow swell. I feel like I should applaud."

"Uh, um. From the introduction, subjectivity refers to the great spirit of challenge that humans have for not conforming to nature and the environment, while independence is the instinct of life to break free from subjugation. Many people accept that human fate is in the hands of heaven, that birth, aging, illness, and death are simply determined by heaven. However, such an attitude is no different from that of a slave. Therefore, I convey the meaning of subjectivity and independence to free ourselves from this fate."

"Hmm. Good."

What's so good about it? Is it good to be independent?

Is this exactly the type of talent you want in the North?

Anyway, Qing introduced the Juche Independence Law.

I didn't want to fight a life-or-death battle with the master of Hyeon-gyeong over a pointless trick, so I just changed the name a bit, but the essence of the method is the same.

The robber's expression was now filled with a warm smile.

With an expression that seemed to embody satisfaction itself.

"Oh, then. Can I go now?"

"Hmm? Where are you going?"

"Where are you going? Now that I've taught you martial arts, we should both go our separate ways."

The robber shakes his head at him.

"Haven't you had enough rest? Then we'll have to attack again. When will we have another chance to unleash a full-throttle attack on a master of the current situation without risking our lives?"

That was right.

Even though Qing had been beaten hard in countless sparring matches with Master, he still couldn't unleash a killing blow.

Wouldn't it be a great opportunity to freely attack a more skilled opponent, without risking anything, something I couldn't do in the realm of sparring?

Just hearing it makes it seem like Kangtalma is thinking of Qing in a special way?

Qing's eyes narrowed.

"And if I lose, you'll show me your martial arts skills again?"

"Of course."

"No, what's this person's state of conscience? I'm not some kind of martial arts sack, and you're going to strip me of everything, down to my very foundation?"

Then, the robber's smile becomes filled with murderous intent.

"If you don't want to die, then you should do that, right?"

Oh, right. This kid was a martial arts thief.

After that, I started to get really annoyed.

The problem was that he fought using all kinds of martial arts to create a killing angle.

I know from experience that I have more than one martial art, so isn't it like showing off a thick wallet to a robber?

Would a robber just walk away satisfied with a few high-denomination bills?

However, Qing is no ordinary victim.

Qing lies down on the spot.

"Miss. I don't know. Then why don't you just die? With your stomach full."

"hmm?"

"I'll just pack up all my martial arts and go to the afterlife. If I offer some divine skills to the grim reaper, I might just sneak off somewhere nice. Oh, it feels good to lie down. The ground feels so good."

Kang-tal-ma couldn't hide his bewildered expression at the sight of Qing lying down.

"Do you think I'll just talk?"

"It's the same whether I die this way or that way. I'm going to die anyway, so is there any need to give my enemy martial arts skills?"

"You're going to die anyway? I told you I'd spare your life if you just surrendered your martial arts skills."

"You know what? There's a story from Joseon. An old lady was going to the market to sell rice cakes when a tiger suddenly appeared and threatened her, saying, ‘Oh, I won't eat you if you give me a single rice cake!'"

The expression on Kangtalma's face remains absurd as the tiger story suddenly pops out.

"So, the grandmother threw a rice cake. The tiger bit the rice cake, got excited, and disappeared? The grandmother, shaking off her shock, headed back to the market, but after taking three steps, the same tiger blocked her path again. "Ugh! If you give me a rice cake, I won't eat it."

The tiger, who said he wouldn't eat a single rice cake, chased after the rice cake grandmother until all the rice cakes were gone.

Finally, when Grandma's rice cakes were all gone, the tiger laughed loudly and ate Grandma.

Because I didn't give you any rice cakes.

"Hmm."

"What's the difference? If you keep fighting and you have no more martial arts to offer, you'll kill me. In that case, I'll just throw away the rice cake and be eaten right away. I taught you the Juche method for nothing."

"Ahem, it's not like I intended to kill you, so I was thinking of backing down if you said you had nothing more to offer."

"No, how can you believe that? You said you'd let me go if I taught you martial arts, and then you immediately changed your words."

"Ugh."

The ability to ride the blue line was close to the best in the world even before entering the martial arts world.

The sense of blue whispers.

You can open it!

It was unfortunate that I wasn't the one who was able to kill the treasured plague ghost carrying the bundle of martial arts and the golden goose that lays the golden eggs, Qing.

Of course, I had an intuition that he was not a great person who would give up.

Qing sits up and begins to gently apply elasticity to that strange tongue.

"Excuse me, isn't trust especially important in situations like this? So what if I teach you a few martial arts and then tell you I know nothing? Then you'll just believe me and leave, thinking I'm truly clueless?"

Gongryang Sa-yoon, who was listening, suddenly thought.

What on earth is going on, and what trust is needed between the robber and the victim?

"Hmm."

"So, we can't betray the trust we've built, even if only briefly, with such shallow tricks and quick betrayals. I trusted Kangtalma and taught him martial arts, and Kangtalma trusted me and accepted that as the right decision."

"Hmm. That's true."

"And if you're going to keep tearing it down, you should at least give me time to catch my breath. What would I think if you asked me to give you more as soon as I gave you some?"

"That's true too."

The robber seemed to think about it for a moment.

"Then, I'll come back tomorrow."

"Miss. Are you kidding me? Martial arts aren't like coins you pick up on the street, and it's hard to even find one a day in this world. Let's meet next year. Let's meet right away next spring. Okay? That's fine. Let's meet when the flowers bloom."

"A year is ridiculous. And if you're already hiding among those sect masters by then, how will I find you? I'll come back in five days. What do you think?"

"Is learning martial arts easy? Then it takes six months. Since we met in the spring, how about we meet in the fall?"

"Ten days."

"You're being so firm in your negotiations, Miss. I'm just cutting it in half."

"I also doubled it."

"That's not what I meant. It's not a matter of multiples, I just reduced the number of days. A year to six months is over 180 days—"

"Full moon."

"Use it."

Qing pretended to stop.

The robber's expression was proud.

But in the end, isn't the situation where they keep tearing it down for years now a situation where they've retreated to a robbery once every two weeks?

In fact, since the robber had simply threatened with a knife, Qing had no choice but to make concessions, regardless of the robber's satisfaction, it was a situation where one-sided concessions were being made.

This is one of the subtleties of trading.

When making a request, start with an outrageous amount and then reduce it sharply.

Then, the other party will quickly fall into the illusion that you are a great negotiator.

"Hmm, well, let's meet up once a season. Summer would be fine."

"……Twenty days."

"Then, let's do it for a month. Let's do it for a month! Exactly one month. It's early February now, so we'll see each other in early March! How about it! I'll just die if it's less than that. Seriously, I can't do it!"

"ha."

The robber sighed deeply and stood with his hands spread open awkwardly.

Then, a black-clothed thug hurriedly put the weapons he had taken off from the robber horse on his back, hung them on his waist, and put them back on.

That is, it meant that they would not fight anymore.

Martial arts thief vs. martial arts robber, a sudden agreement!

Martial arts robbery once a month!

No one will understand what kind of agreement this is, but anyway.


CHAPTER 907

There was a minor incident, but it was ultimately resolved amicably.

but.

The fact that a master of Hyeon-gyeong suddenly appeared while walking down the street left a deep sense of unease in Qing's heart.

No, no matter how continental the climate is, even if it's the Zhongyuan, a vast landmass filled with countless people, isn't it crossing the line for such a master to appear without any warning?

Of course, the current situation may be unfair to the high-ranking officials.

He is a person on an uninhabited island, and he is not a tree that has just taken root in one place, so of course he can move around.

From Hyun-kyung's perspective, all the people she passes by while walking around are just people who suddenly encounter Hyun-kyung's master.

If you look at it that way, it's not unreasonable, but, well, definitely, this isn't right.

You'll either need to quickly take a picture of the current situation and walk confidently anywhere in front of everyone, or you'll need some kind of method to deal with the current situation.

In the current situation, even though the opponent was watching, I couldn't defeat him.

If I open my mouth and make him angry, if I make him lose his senses, he might be able to get out of his way, but then I'd be putting myself in danger too...

Strength! We need more strength!

We need overwhelming power!

Qing yearns for strength again.

It's not like I desperately want some kind of power, so I don't hear a needlessly serious voice saying, "Do you need power?"

The completion of the Dokgo Gugeom was postponed indefinitely due to Emperor Mucheon's anger.

However, it is not like you can suddenly reach the realm of the Hyeon-gyeong by doing special training or using dragons like closed-door training.

So, the only way to gain strength right now, to strengthen my power, is to gather all of the ten greatest magicians in the world.

It wasn't that far.

First, once you collect the Pacheonyeokhyeol and whatever, you will be able to exchange the accumulated good karma at least twice.

It's probably possible that it will happen three times, but the problem is that there are no guarantees.

If you change it carelessly and it gets stuck twice, um.

Finding one of the three remaining Ten Great Demonic Arts and finding the last remaining one was a task that was three times more difficult, even if you just look at the numbers.

It's probably not three times as likely, but I don't remember ever being close to math in my life.

Of course, if it's a waste of time this time, you can just exchange it for now and if you don't have enough karma, you can make up for it by beating up bad guys.

If I had to say, I would say it is an all-out war, an all-out war posture to gather the ten greatest magicians in the world.

Qing's determination is rekindled.

There is no time to be like this.

Because we have to search through Jangbaek right away.

"Yeop-bu, come here. Let's go."

Qing calls out to Lu Bu, who is standing next to the robber, who is snorting and snorting, and who has been teasing the robber for a long time.

No, why is it doing that over there again?

Heeeeeek!

At Qing's call, Lu Bu responded with a loud cry and rubbed his nose on Kangtalma's shoulder as if to show off.

"Haha, what a charming horse! Judging by its appearance, there's no other fiercer horse in the world."

"Yeop-yo?"

Hehe! Lu Bu cried again as he looked at Qing.

Even though Qing was fluent in all languages, he didn't have the ability to understand the cries of animals.

With his head standing stiffly and the whites of his eyes shining brightly, adding to Lu Bu's gaze looking down, it somehow sounded like this to Qing.

I don't listen to the weaker ones!

That's not all.

It was Lu Bu who knelt down next to the robber.

Horses are animals that naturally feel most comfortable standing on all fours, so there is only one reason for them to kneel and lower their bodies.

Hurry up, human. Run with me.

"Huh."

Suddenly, Mo Yongjun's young voice seemed to come into Qing's mind.

-There are kids like this, Captain? They're sensitive to their master's authority (omitted)

Come to think of it, wasn't it Lu Bu who came to me without any hesitation and acted cute as soon as my master died, without any mourning at all?

Now he was flirting with the robber and hitting on him.

As befitting the name Yeobu, it seems that he already wanted to welcome his third official master.

Judging from the amount of work done, there must have been several owners before, but when Qing named him Lu Bu, at least the owner was that barbarian and himself.

The tendons on Qing's forehead flared.

No, this kid? Just because he lost once, he didn't look back and changed his owner all at once?

"You little bastard, aren't you coming?"

-Hehehe!

"We're done. Tonight's dinner is horse meat. I heard horse sashimi is so delicious. You should know that today is a day when both of us will burst."

-Heehee!

Then Lu Bu hides behind the robber's horse.

Horses are basically large animals, so they don't hide behind a plunder horse.

No, this guy is really funny, isn't he?

As soon as the angle appears, he immediately betrays, and as soon as he sees a better master, he immediately changes his master. His personality, no, his devilish nature is like that.

Before that, that confidence.

Wouldn't it be funny to have this endless affirmation about yourself that if you change owners, they will unconditionally accept you?

Well, seeing as how everyone who saw Lu Bu was talking about the Thousand-Li Horse and all that, who would give up on a famous horse that rolled into their hands?

Qing-i's tingling.

Qing glares at Lu Bu fiercely.

But that was it.

Because, according to the nature of the strong and the weak, it was a request that could not be made to the robber to speak confidently.

So, the best thing that Qing could do was to keep her mouth shut and pretend to be pitiful.

It was actually the best move.

Sir, it seems that Yeo-po is trying to change you into his master. That's absurd. Could you please send him this way?

-If I say so, will you send me back?

Wouldn't a martial arts thief who steals other people's martial arts not steal it?

Rather, he'll giggle and try to take me away, saying, "You're following me as your master?"

But if you just keep your mouth shut, other people will think you're just being cute.

If I just sit there and don't say anything-

"Your Majesty, it seems this beast has changed masters. Indeed, the actions of a mute, insignificant creature."

The Gongryangsa Yoon who was next to him immediately struck the target.

The robber is flawed.

"I already have a horse to ride. But I can't just turn away a beast that came to me on its own."

"So, are you having horse meat for dinner tonight?"

"No, it's obvious that it's a famous horse, so why are you eating it?"

"Aren't you curious? I'm very, very curious about whether a famous horse truly lives up to its reputation. Surely no one has ever eaten a famous horse? After all, it's a freeloader, so there's no need to feel sorry about it, right?"

"Hmm, well, that's true. If a horse changes hands so easily, it'll probably just leave when it finds someone it likes better. In that case, maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to eat a full meal."

"Gulp."

"Well, there will be a lot of meat."

Then, Yeo-po shows off his magical ability by walking sideways with a clattering gait and a panicked cry, and moves away from the two people.

And then, very naturally, he came up to Qing and rubbed his nose as if nothing had happened.

"What, aren't you going over there? I'm going to go and get a lot of the horse meat when they have a big feast."

Hee-ing! Yeo-bu cries out in frustration and looks around, then thrusts his sword in.

Those eyes are exactly like the eyes of a pet dog that has been in an accident and is looking at its owner.

Qing bows her head slightly to the robber with a sour expression.

Well, even if you say you're going to eat them, horses are basically expensive property, so if you take them and sell them, you can enjoy a horse meat festival week for two months, rather than a horse meat feast.

Since he just pretended not to know and sent it away, it is only natural that he should express some gratitude for it.

"Gulp. That's too bad. If you happen to have feelings for that beast, please tell me."

However, Gongryang Sa-yoon seemed to be very sincere, and could not hide the dazzling eyes that flashed like the number ten, so Lu Bu's voice trembled.

Anyway.

Qing rises above Lu Bu.

Sitting on the top of the yeopo, I rubbed its torso with my thigh in annoyance, and it let out a sigh of annoyance and looked at the distant mountains.

Anyway, I thought I was starting to like this bastard Lu Bu, but I've completely lost interest in him.

"Oh, let's go."

When Qing lightly pulled down the reins, Lu Bu walked away quietly like a docile lamb.

It was a truly smooth and elegant maneuver, not the terrifying ride of bouncing up and down with the rough gait of the past.

No, this kid, you can even walk like this? Hey kid, there's no special food for the time being. Just eat some tasteless grass and reflect on it.

So, let's start again.

… … but?

Qing said with a very, very bitter expression.

"hey?"

"Hmm? But why?"

"Were you also on your way to Hwanin City? Then, should I take a different route?"

"Oh, you were on your way to Hwanin City?"

"Oh, then, where are you going?"

"Where are you going? I'll follow you."

The robber answers calmly.

Unfortunately, the content was not calm.

Qing's expression suddenly turns sour.

"No, what are you following me for? We were supposed to meet in a month."

"Dalian is only a month away, but I never said I shouldn't go with you."

"No, isn't this a violation of the agreement? Then I can't follow you and leave. What, if I split the martial arts alliance, you're going to tie me up and lock me up somewhere?"

"It's not like I'm that incompetent. Besides, if you're the Cheonhwageom, your fame will spread everywhere. Even if it's a hassle to find you, it's not impossible, right?"

"But why are you following me around? No, you're an old bum? Don't you have anything to do? Are you someone who drinks all day? No, you're not a bum, so why are you following me around?"

By the standards of his hometown, it was an outrageous outburst of abuse, even for someone called him "elder."

And the same goes for the standards of the Zhongyuan.

But the robber just laughed.

Well, it was in the process of being read and opened, as if it was okay to open it to this extent.

"I'm busy, too. I have a mission to attend to right now. Right? Hey, wasn't that a pretty important mission?"

"Absolutely, absolutely. That's what I heard."

Gongryang Sa-yoon answered.

Then the robber nodded.

"Did you hear? I'm such a busy person."

"No, you have work to do, and it's important work, so why are you following me?"

When Qing asked again in shock, Kangtalma said, "Isn't that something else?"

"I've been seeking martial arts for about five years now. I've met countless martial artists, and besides the common, widely known martial arts, how many truly valuable lessons have I gleaned?"

"How many are there?"

"One. This is the first time you taught me."

Miss. Qing's expression turned sour.

Five years of robbery and barely managed to acquire a single red-bordered martial art? That I was the first to offer it?

So of course I was shocked and my eyes rolled back.

"Collecting martial arts isn't as easy as you think. Those who open their mouths so casually are usually just mediocre ones who've mastered some common martial arts. Those with real martial arts never open their mouths. Even if they do, they're just trying to deceive you."

Suddenly, the atmosphere is filled with complaints and grievances.

But isn't that the robber's situation?

"But?"

"Aren't you going to Manchuria?"

"Uh, why is that?"

"If you pass Baekdu Mountain, you're either in Goryeo or Manchuria."

Goryeo disappeared a long time ago and the current national name is Joseon.

To the people of the Zhongyuan, the center of the world, it didn't really matter whether the barbarians in the east were called Dong, Goryeo, or Joseon.

Even for the Qing, this place is a pseudo-Zhongyuan anyway, and it's not even my Joseon anyway, so there's no obligation to fix it.

"Goryeo doesn't matter, but there's a certain nasty master in Manchuria. He's a level, no, two levels better than me, and as far as I know, he harbors a considerable grudge against you."

"omg."

Qing was surprised.

If he's one or two steps better than Gangthalma, then he's also a master of the current situation, but that master holds a grudge against me?

"No, why? I don't even know who I am, and what did I do? No, who was that expert in the first place?"

"I can't say that. I have my own circumstances. Anyway, given the circumstances, if you go to Manchuria and suddenly die, what will happen to my martial arts?"

No, why is my martial arts called 'my martial arts'?

My martial arts are mine, and of course, some of them are Shaolin and some are Namgung Sega, so the ownership is mixed up in a complicated way.

Anyway, Qing's attitude softens a bit.

There's an unidentified police officer in Manchuria, in Jilin, who hates me. If I die, the martial arts he entrusted to me will disappear, so he said he'd go with me and mediate—

"No, mediation won't do. I told you. He's a foul-tempered man. He'll never let go of his grudge. If we ever run into each other, I'll hold him back, so run away."

It's not mediation, it's letting you run away.

Hey, what's up with that?

"Um. Oh, thank you?"

Qing expressed her ambiguous gratitude.

In any case, isn't it true that he followed me because he said he would protect me? And he followed me, even abandoning the duty of unconditional and absolute obligatory.

Of course, this part is a bit less reliable.

I wonder if a master like Hyeon-gyeong really needs new martial arts skills so desperately and desperately, as he abandons really important missions and follows me to steal some martial arts skills.

But just looking at the Great Emperor Mucheon, he was completely obsessed with martial arts.

If you think of it as a choice between something you have to do and personal self-fulfillment, it's not to the point where it's not understandable.

Anyway, thinking about it this way, it didn't seem like a bad idea for the martial arts instructor to follow.

Like that, with the humps attached to the left and right.

Jang Baek-haeng, starting again.


PART 91 Tang Sanzang and The Fourty Bandits
Mix of 'Journey to The West' and 'Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves'

CHAPTER 908

Unfortunately, there were no villages to stop by on the way to Hwaninhyeon, so what the heck, it was just a night's sleep.

So, before the sun went down, we lit a bonfire, placed a Mongolian pot on top of it, and started boiling Ximen Qing's special honey porridge and Cheonhwa yeongyang porridge.

"The Juche Self-Driving Method is a much more mysterious method than the Baekryun Method."

It was the sound that the robber suddenly let out.

Qing's ears perked up.

Baekryundo, each and every one of those afterimages is a martial art that truly performs infinite continuous attacks, and it seems to be called Baekryundo Technique.

Since I had already read in the thoughts of the robber demon the will to practice diligently, mastered through countless repetitions, the name Baekryeon was very fitting.

But, um, what is it, it's got a blue border... ... .

Then suddenly I felt sad.

No, you took pictures of the current situation with your blue martial arts, so why do you go around stealing other people's martial arts?

"Well, yes, it is definitely something with extraordinary depth, yes, this is what you would call a divine skill."

He said he had never learned a proper martial art before, but after learning a martial art with a red border, he was talking about a new skill.

Well, I guess there's nothing you can do if you've only seen blue your whole life.

He pretends not to hear and stirs his porridge.

Since he is a character obsessed with martial arts, I was afraid that if I spoke to him for no reason, he would say something like, 'So, why don't you teach me just one more thing?'

However, the words that followed were beyond even Qing's imagination.

"Okay, so anyone who wants to learn, come out."

"Huh."

Then, masked people burst out into the setting sun and formed a formation in a jumble.

"Wait a minute. Sir. This is a different story. Why are you revealing my martial arts to others again?"

The loss of fame can be aggravating.

Why, since when is that your martial arts!

But Qing is confident.

It was a secret weapon left behind by the dead Sapa bastard as his last conscience, so it was the same as asking that damn Sapa bastard, the embodiment of goodness and goodness itself, to use it for good deeds.

Of course, it is my merit, clearly and squarely.

My own proud martial arts, not stolen like the Tathagata Shinjang or Emperor Sword!

Qing doesn't use the Talmyeongdo method in front of others, but perhaps it's because he's too confident.

And the robber was also confident.

"Wouldn't it be better for you to know it yourself rather than to pass it on secretly? Even if I promised to keep it to myself, you'd probably be suspicious the rest of your life. It'd be better for both of us to be open about it."

"No, what is that?"

It was a terrifying logic that left even the world's most incorporeal villain speechless.

"And I am not giving it to others, but to my disciples."

Qing looks over the condition of his disciples.

Although the part where the face was covered was already dirty, as expected, the evil deeds were swarming. If these people had a good teacher, wouldn't they have just treated them like a bunch of robbers if they caught one? Wouldn't they all be pushed out?

"No, but this isn't right. If it's like this, I won't be able to teach you martial arts either. Why, they say they'll spread it everywhere in the world."

"Hmm. This might sound like a bit of a rant, but I have my own reasons. It's a power struggle, you could say. I need to build up my strength. Hmm, otherwise, let's do this. If you happen to have a mind method that goes hand-in-hand with the Juche Self-Direction Method, I'll take it next month. What do you think?"

It was a robbery that said there was no need for a secret method.

Well, since he has already reached the level of Hyeon-gyeong, there is no reason to change his dantian to match his martial arts skills, and it would be a waste of internal energy. Also, even if his Taoist method and internal energy play separately at the level of Hyeon-gyeong, he will be able to unleash his power without any problems.

But not for the disciples, because if you want to change the dantian, it would be better to do it when you are at your lowest level.

That is, he will teach his disciples openly.

"hmm."

Qing weighs it for a moment.

To give Madu, who has already captured the current situation, another tool to use. Or to make Madu's subordinates stronger.

Considering the power of the current situation, the latter is a much better choice.

And I don't know how long the search in the Baekdu Mountains will take, but even if it can't be done next month, at least by the month after that, I'll be able to return to the safety of the Zhongyuan...

If you just go to the Shinnyeomun Gate, that bastard Yeom Hui-yeong is there too, and it's because he only has one eye, but Hyun-kyung is Hyun-kyung.

"Well, you shouldn't say anything else later."

Qing's voice was particularly bitter.

I guess I don't like things that go along with the other person's intentions.

In fact, the robber must have had similar thoughts, so if he decides to hide in the Zhongyuan, doesn't he know that it won't be easy for the Madou to come looking for him?

Still, the reason we agreed to do it once a month was probably because life is long, my life is even longer, and Hyun-kyung's life is also very long, so we should look far ahead.

But, since they don't seem to know at all that the Subjective Self-Driving Law is actually the Law of Demyungdo, if things work out well, there might be an angle where the Great Demon Leader of the Sapa Demyungdo comes out...

Of course, strength, strength is needed!

Overwhelming power! Great power is needed!

It was a request that renewed the will to fight.

Next to me, Gongryang Sa-yoon, who was still looking at me with a spoon in his hand, took a bite and stuffed it into his mouth.

"Oh. It's delicious. It looks like a well-fermented dog porridge, but is the Cheonhwageom actually a surprisingly fermented dish?"

Well, why does this guy keep acting like we're close...?

----

Although Hwaninhyeon is a remote area, it has abundant water sources and fertile sedimentary land, so its population has grown to the size of a city.

Although it also belongs to the land of the Zhongyuan, it is not a city of the Zhongyuan people, but a city of the Jurchen people.

Originally, it was the land of the Jurchen people, but in the distant past, the emperor of the time recommended surrender, and the tribal chief obediently accepted and requested submission.

The emperor then gave the Jurchen tribal leader the title of Jianzhouwei and granted him the right to manage Huanren County for generations to come.

It was the birth of the ruling family of Hwaninhyeon, the Hwanindongga.

At the same time, to the Jurchen barbarians, Hwanindongga is a traitor to the nation, the worst of the worst, who sells the land and soul of the country and lives in luxury.

The Jurchen people were the second most hated traitor in the world!

Because of this, the Manchurian Jurchens would often invade and fight with the Jianzhou Jurchens, so the soldiers of the Zhongyuan would just watch and eat snacks.

The idea is to use Huanrenhyeon as a buffer zone in front of the Manchurian land, or in the Qing hometown expression, as a meat shield.

For reference, the Mengjia tribe was only at the top of the Jurchen people's hatred ranking.

What that means is that there is a worst traitor that is hated the most. So who is the most hated traitor among the Jurchen people of Manchuria?

Of course, you would be the Murong family that surrendered without any demand for surrender.

anyway.

So, welcome!

It has already been over two hundred years since Hwaninhyeon was subjugated to the Zhongyuan, so what kind of grudge did they have during that time, fighting and fighting with the Jurchen barbarians?

On the other hand, the Zhongyuan generously provided support to the Huanren Jurchen tribe to prevent them from being defeated, so the Han people in the Huanren lands were not bad.

As I sat down at the Hwaninjeilgaekjan Onyeoru, the view outside the third-floor private room was no ordinary sight.

The summit of the high eastern ridge, with its high cliffs rising at right angles, stood majestically like a fortress.

As the sun sets in the west at sunset, it casts a crimson glow, and the magnificent natural fortress on the eastern mountain also turns red, creating a truly spectacular sight.

Qing-i stares blankly at the table, then asks for information from Jeom-soi, who has brought a snack table.

"Oh my, sir, you're going to Baekdu Mountain? The Manchurians there are so ferocious. Even the most skilled martial artist has only one life to live."

Beyond Hwaninhyeon, it is a truly lawless area, an area where the power of the country cannot reach.

"Well, more importantly, have you heard of the Baekdu Mountain monster? They say he's the kind of monster with black veins all over his body and a screaming voice."

"Are you talking about the costume play? A group of thieves imitating ghosts. But I've never heard of such ghosts."

"Well, does anyone know? Or where can I find the gang of thieves known as the Gajeongnoripae?"

"No one dares to come near here, and if you go up the Yalu River, you'll probably run into one."

Well, the Yalu River.

I feel a bit strange because I've been in the Zhongyuan all along and suddenly a familiar place name appears...

Something, um, it's been a while since I've been thinking about my hometown.

Qing stares blankly into space, thinking of his hometown after a long time, and the world beyond.

It seems like it had a different meaning to Jeomsoi.

As luck would have it, in that direction, there was a natural wall on top of the mountain, a terrain called a mesa in the Kojaeng language.

It seemed as if he couldn't take his eyes off the magnificent view, so Jeomsoi added a commentary.

"Isn't it wonderful? That's Hwaninhyeon's famous landmark, Onyeosanseong Fortress."

"Ohnyosanseong? What is it? Why does it feel familiar? Oh, the Chronicles? It suddenly comes to mind? Why? What was it?"

"It is a sacred land where the Goguryeo dynasty was born in the distant past. In the past, it was also called Jolbonseong, right?"

"Ah, sleepyhead. Sprinkle the squirrels. Hmm."

"Are you talking about squirrels?"

"No, I was just saying. Ah, that's the original name of the city. Goguryeo…"

Is that Goguryeo the same Goguryeo I know?

Even if that's true, does it have anything to do with me?

I don't know about the Goguryeo of the other world, but in this world, Goguryeo, isn't there not a single trace of that blood mixed in with this body?

So, what am I in this world?

Suddenly, I felt my heart drop.

An unfamiliar feeling, as if the world suddenly becomes unfamiliar.

I thought the excruciating loneliness of feeling alone in the world was getting better, but of all things.

Qing's hand begins to twitch slightly.

That was the moment.

"Did you eat like that and then go back in?"

"My dear."

He was a squirrel-like, cheek-puffing, munching on crackers. "Oh, he knows how to eat." "Yeah, that's how you eat it. It's delicious when you eat it like that. It's only when you fill your mouth with it that you can chew it."

"What does it taste like? It's so sweet, my mouth feels numb, it's amazing. Hey, you eat it."

"It's a lecture."

The robber thrusts his plate in front of Gongryangsa Yoon.

By the way, what is the relationship between those two?

It seems like he is not a disciple, and the way Kang-robber pretends not to care for him is like a blunt father.

Are they a father and daughter? They don't look alike at all.

Then suddenly a face comes to mind.

"Hmm, I miss you, Ja-ya. What are you doing now? Studying? Hmm, even if you just grow up healthy, it seems like it's starting to get dangerous."

Still, if a person wants to live like a human, he must avoid being blind. If he is just going to run wild and be healthy, is he a human or an animal?

My heart feels warm and fuzzy.

Somehow, I feel full even though I haven't touched dessert yet.

Is this what fatherly love is? Thinking about your child fills you up even without eating?

Even though Qing emptied five plates of food, anyway.

Come to think of it, what could be lonely about?

Anyway, when I get home, I'll be there for Ja-yeo and Jang-myeong, and it seems like it's about time for Master to come back.

On the way back, Murong Se stopped by, took a picture of Hebei, took a picture of the Murim Alliance, and then Zhuge Se, no, there's also a way to go from Hebei to Jiangnan, then stopped by Gongsun Gongga in Nanjing, took a picture of Namgung Se, and then Zhuge Se stopped by, right?

It's been a while since I've seen Miss Gongsun, so I think it would be a good idea to go to Nanjing while I'm at it.

A warm smile appears on Qing's face.


CHAPTER 909

After eating breakfast in Hwaninhyeon, the group headed south along the Hon River, which flows south.

Qing is on horseback, and the two people in the group who were not specifically invited are not riding.

No, I wouldn't call this a party.

It's just a bonus that's unilaterally attached to the martial arts intensity like a leech, so it shouldn't be called a party.

And since they weren't a group, there was no need to be considerate, so Qing just let Lu Bu walk if he wanted to, run if he wanted to, and do whatever he wanted.

However, it is impossible to shake off the unmanned forces of Hyeon-gyeong to that extent.

I was worried that they would run away if they kept chasing me while I was running and walking, but they were really annoying.

As you continue south along the river, you will reach the end where it joins a larger river.

A large river.

Originally, it was a river famous for its unique green and jade-colored water, and the appearance of its enchanting water color was as beautiful as the feathers of a mallard.

So people called this river the green of the mallard duck's feathers, the Yalu River.

The Yalu River, which freezes over in winter, retains its ice until the end of March.

So, at this time, the Yalu River is still covered with ice, so it looks desolate, frozen white rather than green.

Anyway, so the Yalu River!

The Qing River flows along the riverbank, heading towards the increasingly higher eastern highlands.

When the Yalu River bends inward, shallow land is exposed due to accumulated sediment, and when it bends in the opposite direction, a cliff is exposed, so it goes behind the mountain for a while and then comes back to the riverside several times.

It seemed like he was really bored when the robber approached him.

"I've been thinking about it, and the mysterious man from Baekdu Mountain you're looking for is probably one of the ten greatest magicians in the world who mastered the Pacheonyeokhyeolsusimjacheomgyeol. He's got black veins, so I'm thinking about that."

"What if it's true? Are you also interested in the Pacheon Station blood transfusion center?"

"You, you think magic is magic for nothing? You've reached the realm of the Mine, so you think magic seems easy. But if you rely on it so much, you'll never see the end of the Mine. You should think about breaking free from magic. Why would you even think about adding more evil to it?"

"hmm."

That's true, though.

It feels a bit strange to hear that from a martial arts master.

"But Cheonhwageom, does that mean there is a blood demon in Baekdu Mountain?"

"I'm not sure. I heard there are frequent sightings like that, so I'm going to check it out."

"Most likely, it's a unique culture in this area where people dress up as monsters and go on raids. Could this rumor have originated during that process?"

"Still, I'll give it a try. As far as I know, there aren't any monsters with the characteristics of a reverse-blood demon, so it's not completely impossible."

"But I've never heard of such a rumor. Instead, I'd recommend exploring the delicious cuisine of the Tongwha Land and Baeksan region."

Oh, you're a woman who knows how to travel?

Just by the way you eat, you can tell that you know how to eat well. Yes, traveling is all about food.

Qingdo is a little tempting, but now is not the time to travel so peacefully, and more than anything, why are you sneakily linking us up?

"If you want to eat, you can go here with the elders and eat. Those who want to eat, go eat. Those who want to go to Baekdu Mountain, go to Baekdu Mountain."

"Mt. Baekdu is very vast. Are you trying to search all of its vast expanse? That's incredibly inefficient."

"You can just ask around and spread rumors about the monsters you meet along the way, but it's not that inefficient."

"Even if such customs were prevalent, plundering wouldn't occur multiple times a day. Even if we assume the Yalu River basin, stretching from the eastern side of the Hon River to Mount Baekdu, we can't guarantee that even one plundering incident would occur daily."

"But?"

"So, you're hoping that the gang, who just happened to be out on a plundering spree, will stumble upon the Cheonhwageom? I can't fathom what kind of confidence you have. The odds of such a situation occurring are extremely, extremely rare. Now, let's find something tasty—"

Qing smiles at him and extends her hand.

A long, white, and elegant finger points to one side, and Gongryangsa Yoon's head turns to follow it.

There was a group of strange people there, who looked inhuman.

"And then it happened."

"Ugh. So this is what it means to be ‘angry.'"

Qing stared blankly at the so-called 'most playful group'.

A creature wearing a rag of animal skin over a thick cotton coat, with horns carved from wood sprouting from its hat. It seemed like a goblin.

What did they put on his face? They painted it white and then painted it black. Oh, that's a jangseung (traditional Korean totem pole). They painted it exactly like a jangseung's face.

Of course, the level of makeup was so-so and so poor that anyone could tell it was a person imitating a monster.

In the first place, it's not like a monster would be wearing cotton clothes because it's cold and look all puffed up.

A group of monsters emerged from the forest on the other side of the Yalu River and stopped in their tracks when they saw Qing.

When you look at them locking eyes and moving their snouts, it seems like they are arguing about what to do.

However, since Qing had already turned his horse's head, he crossed the Yalu River with the sound of Lu Bu's hooves, who seemed frightened.

Fortunately, the ice broke and no disaster occurred in the icy river water.

As we approached the riverbank, one of them suddenly screamed.

"That, that's right! That's right, let's tie it up!"

He was a Qing who was proficient in all languages.

Of course, he had never made any effort for it and it was just a linguistic ability that he had acquired by eating it raw, but the meaning that Qing heard was this.

Stop. I mean stop.

Ah, this is a foreign language, but what can I do? It doesn't seem like a foreign language, but it's understandable.

"## #### #####……!"

"### ##### #######……!"

"You bastard, you bastard #####……!"

Oh, but it's such a foreign language...

As soon as I started to speak, I heard a strange accent, a completely foreign language that was almost unfamiliar to me, unlike the Korean language I heard in the Zhongyuan.

Well, there was a time difference of nearly four hundred years between Qing's hometown and here in Joseon.

Four hundred years is enough time for language to change so much that it becomes unintelligible.

Of course, Qing can understand.

Those guys from the Ming Dynasty, aren't they? Dangnyeon, whatever, aren't they the Dang Wae Yeon guys?

Why are those guys just flying around? Isn't that what it is? It's just annoying when you mess with them for no reason.

Aren't you guys kids?

Those bastards don't look like that, they're just the bastards of the same age.

The Tangnom Tangnyeon, or Tangwaeom Tangwaeyeon were derogatory terms used by Joseon people to refer to people from the Zhongyuan.

The term "Doenom Doenyeon", which is familiar to the Qing, is not a derogatory term referring to the people of the Zhongyuan, but to the Manchurian, Jurchen, and barbarian tribes.

In the Qing Dynasty's homeland, the Manchus eventually took over and conquered the Zhongyuan, so the people of the Zhongyuan inherited the Doenom Doenyeon, but here in the primitive, ancient, and pseudo-Zhongyuan, this was not yet the case, so the Qing Dynasty became the Tang Dynasty or the Tang Wa Dynasty.

Here, the Tang refers to the Tang Dynasty, and the Wa of the Tang Wa refers to the Wa pirates, meaning that it was a derogatory term used to refer to the Tang Dynasty or the Wa pirates.

Then, for some reason, Gongryang Sa-yoon felt proud.

"Oh, Cheonhwageom. We've found the best group of players, but we won't be able to communicate at this rate. Haven't you considered this? Well, let's stop wasting time and go enjoy some culinary delights. Manchuria is famous for its deer meat and all kinds of mushrooms, and is especially famous for its pine mushrooms and ginseng. Just thinking about it makes me gulp, excited."

It was a public servant who thought it was time to hit him and force him to go eat.

Hmm. Deer meat and mushrooms? I've never had deer meat before. That looks delicious.

however.

Why does this guy keep acting so friendly…?

Well, you could say it's a blind spot in the psychological gap.

Ximen Qing was a famous person who attracted the attention of all the sisters, including Gongryangsa Yoon, so it was natural that they were happy and friendly.

Because it was a one-sided feeling of intimacy, Qing couldn't help but wonder why he kept acting so friendly.

Of course, Qing is the type to accept without hesitation if the opponent approaches first, but this guy is the best friend of the martial arts master, Daemadu… … .

It was the first time Qing had seen Gongryangsa Yoon, and she couldn't help but feel awkward as she was in a group of martial arts thugs.

Anyway.

Qing gazes intently at the Joseon monsters chattering leisurely.

These are a bunch of thieves.

They are a group of thieves, but they pretend to be monsters and hide their true identities, so they can be said to be a very vicious group even among thieves.

And there is a saying, "Bun-tang (焚蕩) is a burning fire."

It means to cause a very noisy and commotion.

Another meaning is to plunder or pillage other people's property.

So these were going to be a hit in both senses.

And Qing is also an expert in the field of buntang, no, not an expert, but a genius in buntang, a murderer born for buntang, just buntang itself, an authority in the field of buntang who would not feel out of place even if he were to call himself Ximen Buntang.

"[Oh my! All sorts of monsters have gathered here! You bastards, how dare you come out into the human world and wreak havoc!]"

As the fluent Joseon language came out of Qing's mouth, Gongryang Sa-yoon's eyes lit up.

"[What did you say!]"

"[You were Korean? Why were you the only one with something covering your face? Aren't you an interpreter?"

"[What kind of interpreter is riding alone? No, what kind of horse is that woman riding so outrageously? That's not our country. Of course. There's no way a Korean woman would do something so outrageous.]"

It seems like there are a lot of men with clubs there, and there are only three here, so it doesn't seem like there's any tension.

He took a deep breath and sighed.

"conflict!!!"

The transcendent power of humanity takes the initiative.

The monsters, startled by the thunderous, thunderous voice, looked at Qing, who raised his hand in front of his forehead and continued speaking.

"[You bastards, I am the Tripitaka. I have descended to the underworld again at the request of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva to eradicate the hordes of monsters wreaking havoc on the world. I, the descendant, have met you monsters. It was a good meeting, and I have defeated you all.]"

The monsters look at each other.

Monk Tripitaka? The one from Journey to the West?

Monk Tripitaka is weak, no, why is Monk Tripitaka a woman in the first place?

Are you just a crazy bitch?

"Shut up! I am the very same Samjang, the Samjang who slaughtered all the monsters, defeated the king of monsters, the great demon king, the Umawang, and brought peace to the world!"

In fact, Journey to the West is famous, but surprisingly, very few people have read it properly.

I understand that Tripitaka, Sun Wukong, and the two famous monks, Pigsy and Sandy, travel together.

Few people knew why he traveled and what anecdotes he encountered during his travels.

Qing is also like that, so why is it that Tripitaka and Son Oh-gong joined forces to defeat the Demon King, and why is the Ox Demon King also a Demon King? Isn't it a story of a warrior defeating the Demon King, roughly like the Zhongyuan style?

I haven't read it, but I have some experience in video games, so it looks like it's probably a good idea.

"[Now, look! Thousand-Soul Avalokiteshvara! I'll kill all of you monsters and then I'll go to hell. If I don't go to hell, who will? It's you! The monsters are going to hell!]"

Suddenly, Qing spreads both arms wide to the left and right.

Two arms meeting above the head, drawing a large circle.

In an instant, a soft golden light spreads out magnificently.

Then, Qing swung his sword in a large circle, drawing a circle in the opposite direction, leaving behind countless golden arm afterimages along its path.

A huge halo spread out behind the blue.

It was also a remnant of a golden arm, like a majestic halo created by a thousand outstretched hands.

Tathagata's Divine Palm, Eighth Movement, Thousand-armed and Thousand-eyed Tathagata.

It's a moment when the supreme power of the world's greatest martial artist is unleashed for such a trivial reason!

"[Oh my, it must be Buddha!]"

"Oh my, Buddha, I was wrong!"

"[That's a misunderstanding! We're not monsters! We're not monsters!]"

The monsters who saw that sight had no choice but to immediately fall down and tremble while crying out for misunderstanding.


CHAPTER 910

Qing carefully examines the faces of the monsters.

In fact, the makeup is so crude that it looks like someone smeared ash on their face or beat up peat.

However, thanks to that, he became a grotesque creature like a monster, and if we were to be exact, he would be closer to a primitive man than a monster.

Anyway, it wouldn't matter if we just killed the gang of robbers who were causing chaos in the world.

First, I planned to defeat one monster as an example, and then tell you all to tell me about the strange man in Baekdu Mountain if you wanted to live.

But beyond the crude makeup of wooden horns or animal skins, the miserable faces that were not hidden at all left Qing speechless.

Because it was filled with the tired gloom characteristic of those who were shabby, hungry, cold, and dirty, unable to even take care of the basic needs that are fundamental human needs and that would be very, very sad if they were to be without them.

"[you guys-]"

It was the moment when Qing was just opening her mouth.

A tingling sound. A very ominous sound. Should I say it was a sound, or perhaps a subtle vibration or omen?

This, no way.

Here. One.

The Yalu River is usually frozen until late March, or even early April.

However, there is a huge difference in the thickness of ice between the frozen midwinter and the spring season, around March or April.

Next. Two.

The ice on the frozen river becomes thicker towards the riverbank and thinner as it approaches the center of the river.

There. Three.

Horses are inherently heavy creatures.

In particular, a sturdy horse used as a warhorse would weigh over eight hundred pounds, and when loaded with luggage and food, it would weigh as much as seven or eight muscular, sturdy men.

and.

It was a predicted result, as Qing was standing on the thin ice in the middle of the Yalu River, ready to welcome the monsters.

Jeez!

With the sound of ice breaking, splash!

Ice shards swirl and a simple column of water about half a meter high shoots out, spraying cold water in all directions.

Monk Tripitaka, suddenly obtained!

"Huh!" "Ugh!"

The group of monsters gasped in horror at the sight of Monk Tripitaka suddenly sinking down.

"Oh, what is this?" "Oh, the Thousand Flower Sword?"

Kangtalma, who looks troubled, and Gongryang Sa-yoon, who is looking at the broken ice with a look of excitement and anticipation next to him.

But that was only for a moment.

From the surface of the Yalu River beneath the broken ice, a horse's body suddenly rises.

Heeheeing! Amidst the loud, rough neighing of the startled horse, Lu Bu climbed onto the edge, body first, and flailed his legs.

Then, as a startled horse often does, it suddenly stands up and runs off somewhere.

Everyone's gaze turned towards the horse that was moving away.

And everyone's heads turned again towards the gaping hole in the broken ice.

And after a while.

Something soars violently into the sky.

A woman spraying water droplets in all directions, the lewdness of the famous Odugain revealed by her soaking wet and clinging clothes.

But more than that, the beauty revealed beneath the cotton turban that was turned over and stuck to the front of her head was extraordinary.

Even among the snobbish people of the Zhongyuan, that devastating beauty, considered the most beautiful in the world, is truly a beauty worthy of the nation. This is the face that endangers the nation! It seems as if a roar of fervent argument is being heard.

The Dongyi barbarians, disguised as monsters, gaze up at her beauty in awe.

"[She's a fairy…….]"

Then, one of them suddenly muttered something and everyone nodded in agreement.

Several bonfires were lit along the riverbank, forming a small circle. Among the bonfires, there was a woman and a horse.

"Miss, I'm freezing."

Even though it is a cold winter day, it is impossible to not be cold when you are completely soaked and exposed to the cold wind of the river.

Of course, just standing still right now is already an amazing feat.

Normally, he would have a pale face, blue lips, and shiver, but somehow he would feel more and more comfortable, become sleepy, and feel like he was slowly getting hotter. According to the diagnosis of his hometown, he would show symptoms of severe hypothermia.

In addition to being strong against the cold, it has a monstrous body with durability that surpasses that of humans.

So, we just sat around a campfire and said, "Oh, it's so cold, it's so cold."

So, even the group of monsters kneeling on the riverbank was nothing but a wonder to the Dongi tribe.

The Dongyi people of this region, who fish by digging holes in the frozen Yalu River in winter, knew very well what it meant to fall into the water on such a cold day.

The monk is a very new person, a very new person.

But why is Monk Tripitaka a nun? And what kind of beauty is she, and what kind of body is she?

After all, isn't that the original Journey to the West, the original Journey to the West? Since it was entering Joseon territory, the embarrassing customs were probably changed and brought over.

Hey, those gentlemen are acting tame again!

The scholars of Joseon must have felt wronged, and the Oh clan, the author of the original Journey to the West, must have felt very wronged as well, but anyway.

The Dongi people completely lost their will to resist.

What could a mere mortal do against a fairy who had a halo like that of the Thousand-Armed Buddha and who had calmly emerged from the cold water?

He even went so far as to freeze the broken ice, so he is a god whose supernatural powers are no different from Maitreya's!

Qing just froze it again with the Ice White God skill in case someone else got lost.

anyway.

Only after the river water soaking into his clothes had cooled to a lukewarm temperature similar to body temperature and he felt uneasy did Qing turn his gaze to the Dongi tribe members who had been kneeling and observing him.

In the meantime, they had rubbed their faces hard and erased them, so now they were the Dongi tribe who had turned from monsters into humans, or more precisely, into beggars.

"[I have descended again to capture the Demon King who has been resurrected in the human world, and to capture the Black Blood Demon King, the reincarnation of the Umma King.]"

Qing starts making up stories without even licking her lips.

This is the true power of the liberal arts!

The Black Blood Demon King is literally a monster with black blood flowing through his body, and his skin is covered in black veins, giving him an extremely evil appearance.

But I heard through rumors that the person called the Baekdu Mountain monster is also like that.

So, this body, which has already ascended to the heavenly realm and commands the Buddha on the left and the Sangje on the right, the Jade Emperor will die if he messes with him, and the Supreme Master Tripitaka, who cuts down the Buddha when he meets him, has descended here.

"Phew!"

I think I heard a spitting sound?

When Qing turned his head, Gongryang Sa-yoon, who had a calm expression, tilted his head as if asking why.

I thought she was out of her mind for a sane adult to dare tilt her head, but I decided to overlook her because objectively, Gongryang Sa-yoon is a beauty.

"Hmm, ahem."

Qing clears her throat for no reason.

Well, she pretends not to know, but it looks like even Gongryang So-jeong can speak Korean, ma'am.

A.C., I thought you didn't know Korean so I just yelled at you. If I had known you knew Korean, I would have acted more appropriately.

"Ahem, [Anyway. Does any of you know anything about the monster of Baekdu Mountain, or the vicious Black Blood Demon King?]"

The Dongi tribes are murmuring about him.

While waiting for the blue one of them.

"[Well, I've heard something similar. My sister used to live in a place called Yanggalraegol at the foot of Mt. Baekdu. Last year, when she stopped by on her way south, she said that there was a Taoist priest named Shingwi who was very powerful and hated barbarians and killed them all he saw. Thanks to that, they didn't have a hard time making a living, but the Taoist priest had a very strange personality, a hideous appearance, and an even more bizarre demeanor. Sometimes, even though he was Korean, he would beat to death barbarian spies and such, and I heard that he was scary.]"

"Oh. [You said his veins were dark, like dark lines running down his skin?]"

"I don't know the bloodline, but I heard there are black lines on the skin."

"Oh."

"[What else did he say? When I asked him why he hated barbarians, he said that they were the best Taoist schools in the world, but he made them learn the worst sorcery in the world, so how could he not be his enemy?]"

"Ohhh."

Qing snapped her fingers and made a clicking sound.

Doesn't this fit the bill perfectly?

Black lines on the skin.

I thought it was a new skill, but it was a sorcery?

In other words, it was magic.

It must have been after the magic had already seeped into his bones.

When the will to kill is stirred, there needs to be a reason to kill someone. At first, he blames the barbarians for teaching him magic, and when the barbarians spare his life, he makes excuses and kills fellow Koreans.

"[Really? Yanggalraegol? Where is that?]"

"[Well, I don't know either?]"

The expression on the face of the person answering becomes filled with puzzlement.

A look as if asking why I'm asking that.

"[No, you said your sister lived there? Don't you even know where your sister lives?]"

"Oh my, you don't understand the hardships of slash-and-burn farmers. After three or four winters, there's no firewood, and the ground becomes barren, so they have to leave and start a new slash-and-burn farm. So how could they know when the village keeps changing? Now that I've moved all the way south, I doubt I'll ever see you again.

The man who said that had a gloomy expression.

So, Qingdo, well, at least we've confirmed that there's a reverse blood demon.

Anyway, I was lucky this time.

Not only did he quickly encounter the most popular group of playmates, but he also obtained reliable information.

Besides, I was able to find out the name of the village, Yanggalraegol. Whether the village exists now or not, if you go near Baekdu Mountain, there should be at least one or two people who know about it.

Hmm, this feels good-

No, no. I was feeling good last time and then I ran into a martial arts thief, so thinking about it, I wonder if this isn't just some unlucky question on the level of 'Did I hurt him...?'

Qing tries hard to shake off her good mood.

And then, um, what do we do with these?

It's not that Qing has some strange ambition to erase evil from the world, but he just uses it as an excuse to kill when he feels the urge to do so.

But, such excuses are only fun when you are caught red-handed or when there is clear testimony or other evidence equivalent to that.

It was an attempted robbery, and they were still on their way to committing a robbery, and they all looked like poor, emaciated refugees.

So, what.

Wouldn't it be enough to just get Tyler to promise that he'll never do anything bad again and then send him back?

So, Qing speaks in a solemn voice.

It was such a pleasant voice that it didn't sound particularly solemn to the listener, but that's what Qing thought to himself anyway.

"[I understand you are human, but you planned to imitate monsters and attack civilians. How is your nature any different from that of monsters? Why shouldn't I slay you and benefit the human world?]"

"[Oh, I was wrong!]"

"[Please save me, monk!]"

It was a satisfactory response.

He pretends to be worried and wastes time, saying, "I'm sorry."

And after a while.

"[Good. If you truly repent and wish to live a good life in the future, I will give you one chance. Swear by the gods of heaven and earth that you will stop these monstrous acts and live a life where you will not harm others, even if you do not help them. If you break this, I will descend from the heavens and strike you dead with a single blow. No, I will beat you to death with a painful slap!]"

Although Tripitaka was a monk, I couldn't understand why he was asked to swear to the gods of heaven and earth.

And why is that monk foaming at the mouth, saying he will be beaten to death with painful beatings?

But since Qing's original actions themselves didn't have much context, we can just say that Qing did Qing and acted Qing.

The Dongi tribes looked at each other and-

Watching the mood-

I'm trying to keep an eye on things-

Why is it that they just hesitate and look at each other, and no one answers firmly?

The corners of Qing's eyes twitched.

No, look at these guys?

"What? Why can't you swear? You said you'd spare my life, but you can't swear? Are you saying you're going to spend the rest of your life wearing a demon mask and committing theft?!"

The Dongi tribe member in front of him closed his eyes tightly and shouted.

"[Oh my, Monk! That's tantamount to telling us to die. We have no other way to survive. I don't care what happens to me, but what about my family!? The child is crying from hunger, and there's nothing to feed him. If we don't do this, how are we supposed to live? Yes? Please...]"

At that, Qing's expression suddenly distorted.


CHAPTER 911

Disguised as monsters, they are a group of thieves who commit plunder while hiding their true identities.

Qing is also a master of the clone technique with a unique perspective on makeup, and at times she is the divine Cheonhwageom of the Jeongpa martial arts world, at times she is Da Yeoreum, the living god of the Gwanjinsik, and at other times she is the carnivore-crazy woman and the thief Joo Gil-ryeon who practices justice.

So I knew very well the sense of liberation that came from hiding one's identity and the boldness that came from it.

What are you talking about on that topic?

Can't you make a living without committing robbery?

"[What kind of people with their limbs are these? They have to dig up the ground or scavenge the mountains to make a living. Does it make sense to say that there's no other way to make a living than by robbery? Or did someone threaten them with a knife and tell them to commit robbery?]"

The expression on the faces of the Dongi people brings to mind admiration.

"[That's right. So, a god with extraordinary supernatural powers can see clearly?]"

"Huh."

Qing's expression, which had been raising his murderous intent, becomes completely stupid.

Fortunately, since he was wearing a face mask, the majesty of the Supreme Master, who had conquered the heavens and enjoyed the power of the Left Flame Lord, was not broken.

"What are you talking about? Who really threatened me with a knife? Telling me to go and rob you?"

At the sound of the absurd voice, worry once again appeared on the faces of the Dongi people.

I thought, "It wasn't something you saw with some kind of miraculous power, like clairvoyance or clairvoyance."

"[He didn't point a knife, but it's the same thing. He obviously knows our situation, and he's not even worried about safety—]"

"[Do you even know!? That bastard is going a step further and secretly pushing it! What? Do you think people would starve to death no matter what? If you desperately wish for it, a monster will help you?]"

"[You bastard! You are a bastard without a mother or father!]"

"[That damn bastard, he said that a simpleton is a Hong-eo-jjok, but if he could get away with it, he'd even put a leather needle on a rat!"

"[A guy who would take out his penis and shove it in his asshole. Even if his body is dirty, there is no one as dirty as him.]"

The Dongi people vent their anger and complain.

Since ancient times, the Dongyi people have been a people of swearing, and they use very chilling swear words.

In the past, several decades ago, there was a very large and catastrophic disaster in the land of Joseon.

In fact, even before that, Joseon was a country in turmoil, and the lives of the commoners were extremely difficult.

Even so, Joseon managed to somehow get by, but the problem was that the direction of the situation was going downhill, and although the country was gradually declining, Joseon was still able to make a living.

This gentle downward curve was suddenly punctuated by a huge cliff, which was the Japanese invasion of 1592, the Imjin War.

Qing's expression is subtle.

Well, I'm still taking history lectures in this pseudo-primitive ancient parallel world...

The Japanese invasion was a Japanese invasion, but its terrible aftereffects struck Joseon.

Three-quarters of the farmland was lost due to the Imjin War.

Joseon was already an agricultural country that looked down on commerce, suppressing merchants with great difficulty, and whose industry consisted entirely of home-based handicrafts.

In a country where farming was the only thing that mattered, half of the farmland was cut off, leaving a quarter, so naturally, terrible famine and starvation followed.

And this chaos of people dying is what invites epidemics.

This is also the reason why the four incarnations of destruction that the Western Nose Catholics speak of are all bundled together: war, famine, plague, and death.

So, as a result, three out of ten Koreans lost their lives to the war and its aftereffects, making it a serious disaster that wiped out 30% of the population.

However, most of the three hundred people who disappeared like this were commoners and slaves, that is, the lower class.

The ruling class of Joseon, the Yangban, also suffered great damage.

However, the gap between the rich and the poor before and after the Imjin War actually widened significantly, so people became relatively wealthier than before the war.

The ruling class exploited the commoners and squeezed their blood and sweat during this chaotic era!

"[They are using usury to borrow food, so if you borrow one sack of millet or sorghum, they demand four sacks of rice next year. No matter how much you farm, all that piles up is debt. Everyone sells their bodies, so now there is no one who is not a slave.]"

"[hmm.]"

"[But if the weather is still a bit warmer, we'll dig up wild vegetables from the mountains and eat some of the trees we've peeled, but if we don't go out to play at this time of year, our whole family will starve to death before the weather gets warmer…]"

It's the warm south, and the ground is starting to thaw, so if we just hold on a little longer, we'll be able to survive by eating grass.

Here in Pyeongan Province, especially in this village bordering the northernmost Hamgyong Province, we still have to wait a month and a half for new shoots to sprout.

So, in the end, the only answer to survive is plunder.

"Hmm……."

If I didn't know, I wouldn't know, but after hearing the circumstances, I feel very sorry and pathetic.

Somehow, everyone looked very haggard and had sunken eyes, as if they had not eaten for a long time. It was an unmistakable mark of miserable poverty.

"[Still, rumors are spreading that your raids are so intense every winter. Then, won't the villages across the river that are about to raid also flee? Even if you hold out for now, what are your plans for the future?]"

"[It looks like we're going to starve to death right now, but if we wake up one night and two or three people starve to death, what does the future matter to us…….]"

Qing sighed deeply.

But, it is not right to say to this group of thieves, "Your situation is pitiful, so you should live off of other poor people," and then say, "Cheer up, you are a proud head of a household who works hard to plunder to feed your family, I support you," right?

And, as I heard, there was a solution.

"[I heard earlier that you guys seem to have a lot of regrets about that guy-]"

"[That bastard is such a fucking bastard!]"

"[While all the people in the town were dying, he was the only one pouring oil on his stomach-]"

"It's been over twenty years since the Daedong Law was enacted, and they're still asking me to bring my hopi."

It was a torrent of curses.

Qing nods to him.

"[From what I've heard, it seems like he's the one who should be killed. If what you say is true, the government is taking all the grain. Then, why don't we just rob the government?]"

The ones who created this gang of robbers in the first place were the ruling class of Joseon, especially the local officials.

Just like in the Zhongyuan, Joseon also had a structure where local officials had to earn their own salaries, so the more the people shed tears of blood, the richer the officials became.

This was not a problem unique to Joseon, but rather a primitive and uncivilized administrative system unique to the ancient times, which was the standard of the time.

However, in the Zhongyuan, where resources were abundant, even if the officials squeezed the commoners, the commoners' tables were filled with grass instead of meat, meaning that there was enough production to survive.

They say that the exploitation of officials in the Zhongyuan is the most frightening, but even in that situation, wouldn't there be oil in the kitchens of ordinary people, and they would fry vegetables and meat (stir-fry them - Zhongyuan cuisine involves frying in oil)?

But this is a special case for the Zhongyuan.

Throughout the history of mankind, there have been very few countries where the ruling class could cook and eat.

So, in this barren, war-torn Joseon, how can these poor thieves eat their fill?

And how can I avoid this miserable fate of barely surviving through this kind of theft in the future?

Qing examines the sordid aspects of the monsters.

The excuse that it is for survival can never be an excuse for robbery.

But, what if those who had the duty to take care of them instead drove them into a gang of robbers?

A dangerous color lingers in Qing's eyes.

A color that was nowhere to be found in the world, an ominous light emitted by a lonely evil star.

What can I do, I'll tear and rip the guy who's tearing it apart!

"[Even so, how could that not be treason……]"

"[How can such disloyalty be……]"

"[If the general comes to Hanyang right now with his troops to punish the traitors, not only we, but the entire town will be wiped out……!]"

Of course, there is no country that takes civil unrest lightly.

But Qing tilted his head.

"[So, how long will your plundering continue? The Zhongyuan soldiers are building a wall next to Wihwado Island, and about two thousand people are living there. How can you be sure they won't come storming in because they can't stand it anymore?]"

"[So, isn't that why we ended up like this, this ridiculous pretense? It wasn't us who did it, but the monsters, the monsters…?]"

"[……uh?]"

"[hmm?]"

The Koreans, or rather the monsters, gradually begin to show expressions of realization.

Qing nodded at him.

"[Okay, let's go. Here are Son Oh-gong and Pigsy-]"

"Master, I'll go with Sa-o-jeong. Isn't Pigsy too much? Rather, you, with that massive lump of fat hanging from your belly, are more fitting for the role. But you call Pigsy "Ji-pal-gye"? Not "Jeo-o-neung"? It's what Koreans call it, aren't you? Are you well-versed in not only Korean language but also Korean customs?"

"Miss, you can speak Korean, right?"

"I never said I couldn't do it."

"[Ahem, anyway, Son Oh-gong and Sa-o-jeong were originally monsters, but they've changed their minds and will protect justice under my leadership. I'll lead you monsters for a while. You won't have to worry about the swords of humanity!]"

do.

----

Suddenly, the atmosphere changed and the government office was raided.

So, the first thing to do was obvious.

"[Okay, let's prepare the bamboo spears first.]"

"[Oh, monk? Bamboo doesn't grow around here. Is this really necessary?]"

"[Miss. There is no bamboo spear.]"

"[Why a bamboo spear?]"

"[Well, isn't a bamboo spear truly a symbol of resistance, capable of piercing the bellies of despicable officials? It's easy to make, sharp, and strong. Furthermore, bamboo is a symbol of integrity and loyalty, so isn't forging a bamboo spear to resist oppression doubly meaningful?]"

"[……!]" "[Oh!]" "[Indeed!]"

If someone were to listen, they would say that it is a really good lesson.

However, the feelings of someone listening now were a little different.

"Oh, just now was good. The Thousand Flower Sword doesn't look like anything, but it's strange how it secretly has a strong scent."

anyway.

Behind the blue horse riding on the black horse, the martial arts bandits and monsters follow.

As the group grows larger and larger, it is strange that all of the monsters in the group are robbers, considering that they are a group of robbers.

Or maybe this is what they mean when they say that like things stick together.

And so, just like the founding king of Joseon who turned his army back from Wihwado Island in the past and founded Joseon, the band of monster robbers who turned back their army, or rather, turned back, from the Amnok River proudly head to their hometown, PungQing-ri.

However, as things went on like that, wouldn't the anger of the Qing Dynasty, which had been burning, cool down little by little?

Well, when I heard it, I got so angry and frustrated that I wanted to beat up those bastards, but thinking about it, I wonder if this is okay… … .

And isn't the exploitation of those managers just a one-sided claim by these monster robbers?

Those officials may also have some reason to protest.

They are also starving, but the boss above is ripping them off.

Let's see, who was the current Joseon king? Oh, the famous fugitive king of the Imjin War, and then the one who led the Japanese invasion in place of the fugitive king, and then there must have been a coup. Was there? Or wasn't there?

But how did you defeat those Japanese bastards?

Originally, if you think about it, wasn't the current emperor the one who was famous for being a Joseon enthusiast?

Did the Zhongyuan send reinforcements here too?

Well, let's not really wonder.

Anyway, it's not my Joseon, it's a parallel Joseon that has nothing to do with me… … .

Rather than that, I did it in a fit of anger, but I guess I should hear the opinion of the manager, perhaps the magistrate?

He's not a typical corrupt official, like someone drawn in a painting.

Qing decided to try to resolve the issue through conversation.

I thought so too.


CHAPTER 912

The sight of Qing leading a band of demonic bandits on a black horse was, in many ways, more convincing to the Uma King than to the monk Tripitaka.

Anyway, PungQing-ri, the northeastern tip of Pyeongan Province.

The view of the town from afar seems somehow familiar.

Thatched houses are a common architectural style in agricultural cultures, and are not uncommon in the Zhongyuan.

Still, somehow, I feel a sense of familiarity, as if I've come to a folk village or a historical drama stage in my hometown. Hmm, is it just a psychological factor?

By the way, that thatched house looks really cute… … .

In fact, the people who live there are not cute at all.

It's not cute, it's quite horrible, and it's a property of love and hate that we try to console ourselves by saying that a house is just something with a roof and that only blocks the wind.

Because it's too narrow and full of bugs...

The basic structure of a thatched house is one room and a separate kitchen, which is the three-bay, thatched-roof house, which is called the national standard of Joseon.

The pyeong of this thatched-roof house is the world's most scientific and excellent unit of measurement, which anyone can intuitively understand the area of as soon as they hear it, and which will never disappear. If we measure it in 'pyeong', the pyeong of this thatched-roof house is about 15 pyeong, and excluding the kitchen, it is about 10 pyeong.

The whole family lives in one ten-pyeong room.

In this era, the average man's family consisted of two parents, one wife, and four to five children, so eight or nine people had to live together in a ten-pyeong room.

It's literally like there's no separate cage for animals.

But there is no problem!

This is because the common people (sangnom) who originally lived in thatched houses in Joseon were always treated as animals by the ruling class.

Even when Joseon was at its most prosperous, what was the reaction of the ruling class, the yangban, when a sage king tried to create and teach letters?

Why do those beasts need letters?

A truly bold statement of conviction in front of the king who had expressed his love for the people!

Considering that this was the most lenient period in Joseon history towards the commoners, it is clear that to the ruling class of Joseon, these people were not people from the beginning, but rather part of their property, animals.

And, if a pet, for example a dog, is biting and gnawing on a pheasant, what should the owner do?

"Oh my, what is this? Where on earth did you catch such a sturdy horse? And what kind of horse is it? Were there even monsters in the eight provinces of Joseon that looked like women on horseback? What does that have to do with anything? Hiya, it's a truly exquisite horse. Could the Ochu horse from the Book of Chu and Han be this horse?

What is this?

It was a man with a kind face who suddenly ran out and blocked my way.

Unlike the monsters with sunken cheeks and a round face, he had a very neat appearance.

There's a hat on his head, and oh, it's really a hat? It's kind of cool, isn't it?

As Qing looked down at the subtle beauty of the real god, a style that shone even in the primitive ancient times, the man added a kind smile.

"[So, you brought such a famous horse. According to national law, anyone who slaughters such a famous horse for personal gain is liable to be severely punished, correct? Well, then, for your sake, I suppose we should send this horse to Hanseong.]"

A deep valley appears between Qing's eyebrows.

What is this kid, he's eating other people's words, so why send him to Hanseong and he's talking as he pleases?

Of course, if it were Lu Bu's personality, he would not have burned such a weak barbarian, and would have run away again to find a new father.

Well, it's kind of tempting to catch and eat them.

Purrung, perhaps it was the beast's intuition, but Lu Bu let out an uncomfortable cry and took a couple of steps back.

"[But you've worked hard, so I can't send you away empty-handed. I'll even give you some grain, so you can eat a hearty meal today. Okay? Come on, come down quickly. Okay, give me the reins. Okay?]"

His blue eyes draw a pretty crescent moon.

But there was no luster in those eyes, and instead, there was a sinister light.

Qing bends down and stretches out her arms toward the man who is reaching out for the reins.

Unusually white and long fingers grasp the man's gentle lower body and lift it up.

A god who lifts a man with one hand!

The newlywed man was hanging on with both arms, clutching Qing's wrists with both hands, his legs trembling and his jaw about to fall off.

"Ugh! Ugh!"

"What is this kid doing, robbing so brazenly? Why does he take other people's words without permission?"

"Ugh!"

"[And what? Give me some grain? If I go to the Zhongyuan, I'll steal a fine horse that's worth a cartload of gold, for a mere grain?]"

"Ugh! Ugh!"

The corners of Qing's mouth form a curve.

When Qing gets angry, his expression becomes distorted, but when he gets really angry, his mouth cracks and a wicked smile appears.

If those who know Qing were to categorize the stages of anger, they would diagnose him as being in the stages of Sono, Moderate, Great, Extreme, and Greatest anger.

"[This kid is funny, isn't he? He ate so well by himself that his face is covered in dog oil. What? Why bother?]"

The corners of Qing's mouth extend all the way to his ears.

Blue, I'm angry! I'm so angry!

"[This kid, you know exactly what these guys are doing around here?]"

Even when I was heading to this village, I thought that maybe the local magistrate had something to say, so I thought I'd at least hear what he had to say.

There's no need to listen to this story.

They didn't show any surprise or fear when they saw the gang of robbers dressed up as monsters, but rather they approached them with a big smile, so they were already used to it.

And since they came out very quickly, it means that this group of monster thieves knew roughly when the most popular group would return and were waiting for them.

why?

To steal the loot stolen by a group of thieves, one must steal from thieves, so to speak, a thief-thief.

"[Hey, what is this kid doing?]"

"[Oh, that. Our room is coming down.]"

"[Foreigner? Oh, the magistrate?]"

"[Are you talking about a ttak-kari? You're really good at Korean, but you're not a ttak-kari. Doesn't a ttak-kari refer to a servant who does nothing but clean up after others?]"

"[Then what is it?]"

The eyes of the monster answering him flashed.

"[This kid is worse than the magistrate. If I had to say, he's a lackey. The two of them are really attached to each other, biting and sucking, it's really fucking crazy.]"

The head of a Joseon province is the magistrate.

And under the magistrate, there were local officials who were in charge of administrative affairs, and among these local officials, the six administrative representatives were called Yukbang.

Foreigner, hobang, prevention, sergeant, officer, public servant, public servant.

And these six factions are the vanguard at the pinnacle of corruption in Joseon.

Among these, the three foreigners, Ho-bang Hyeong-bang, and Hyeong-bang are grouped together and called the Samgong-hyeong. They are the scum of the earth, the absolute worst of the worst.

Among them, the power of the foreign power is the most powerful, so in fact, the foreign power is the worst nightmare that Joseon has ever created.

As the saying goes, there may be a rare sage among the rulers, but among the eight provinces of Joseon, there is not a single one who is not trash.

Even when a very rare and good leader who was willing to carry out a selection was appointed, there were many cases where the foreigners mobilized the six factions to kill and bury the leader.

Thanks to that, the good leader was killed by a foreigner.

The surviving leaders are evil leaders who collude with foreigners and exploit the people, so it is no exaggeration to say that the fundamental cause of corruption in Joseon lies with these foreigners.

The PungQing-ri foreigner was also a total piece of trash, a complete piece of trash, befitting a foreigner.

The six factions, including the leader who was in league with foreigners, colluded to exploit the people in every way possible.

It is said that among the commoners of PungQing-ri, there was not a single family where no one starved to death.

The children's upbringing is also excellent, so when they are bored, they beat the slaves and make them crippled.

Since the entire eight provinces of Joseon are poor and there is no shortage of meat side dishes, there are rumors that they must be eating human flesh from an unknown source.

Those who forced me to steal, saying, "If you stay still, you'll get rice or meat, or go out and catch a monster," were also foreigners.

The one who took most of the grain he had lent out, claiming it was interest on the crops he had harvested through theft, was also a foreigner.

"[So, that's what you're saying? Do you have anything to say?]"

Behind a dark hill outside the village.

The stranger, kneeling, suddenly shouts at Qing's question.

"[T-Do you think you'll be safe after this? The laws of this country are strict-]"

Well, I'm out of my mind.

It was the moment when Qing raised his hand to strike.

"How dare you! This bastard! To the Dharma Master!"

"How dare this kid talk back!"

"[Respect! Respect! Respect the Dharma Master!]"

One of the monsters kicked the stranger's shoulder with a flying kick, and the remaining monsters rushed in, kicking and trampling the stranger, and beating him with their clubs, leaving him with a harpoon.

Well, there were a lot of things piled up… … .

Qing awkwardly lowers his hand, which he had raised to strike, and returns it to its original position.

But, um, still.

Isn't this it?

If you keep doing that, you're really going to get caught.

"[stop!]"

A majestic cry calms the hordes of monsters that were trampling the foreign land.

"[Leave it at that. You'll die if you keep doing that.]"

"[Monk, this guy is not worth living, he deserves to die, he's a son of a bitch!"

"Oh my, there is no bastard in this world who deserves to die. How can you end a human life so easily?"

"[Haona-]"

"[Oh my.]"

The monsters slowly back away, with expressions of resentment and indignation, but as if they cannot give up, they seem very reluctant.

Then, the foreigner, who was desperately crouching with his arms and legs tied, looks up at Qing.

The earnestness contained therein.

Qing snickers at him.

"[You bastards, death is the end, and it's just comfortable. The longer you live, the longer you'll suffer, the more you'll regret and repent for your sins. You should skin them alive in a prominent place, sprinkle some dirt on them, and let them starve to death. Why do you want to kill them in an easy way?]"

"[Gasp!]" "[That's right!]" "[We wouldn't go that far-]" "[Shut up! If I think about it, all my children starved to death because of that bastard! The priest is absolutely right!]" "[That's right! That bastard shouldn't die in peace!]"

Then, Gongryang Sa-yoon whispered to Gang-tal-ma.

The robber was greatly impressed.

"That's exactly what a true demon, the greatest of demons, would say! What a vicious bitch! The world-renowned Cheonhwageom could kill like this!"

"I didn't want to hear that from a martial arts master."

"This is a compliment. It's said that a man is not a man without his venom. So, if there's a matter of killing someone, would you like to join us? Our compatriots are undertaking a project, and you would be most welcome."

"Well, if you're only going to kill those who need to be killed, why don't you think about it?"

"Well, unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case. If you still can't control your killing instincts, come back later."

Blood Cult's recruitment offer!

Since Qing did not know the true nature of the business that his compatriots were carrying out, he wondered if he was an old man who was fighting for independence among the barbarians.

anyway.

The hordes of monsters that have seen blood show their white eyes with a murderous glow, just like real monsters.

R1o1RUY1V2dWdFByellBWDZwUWJGWmF1NG9YNC9LTmtZcGlvZitON2sxbzR5MmY3NktrbWtQNVJsRi80Q0xEYw

In response, Qing mounted his horse and let out a brave shout above Lu Bu, who had both feet raised high.

"Now, tie him to his horse! I will rush him to my office and utterly destroy him! When your bodies are burned, you too will be free! Now, let's go! Sing the song of the angry people! Buddha, bring on the wrath!"


CHAPTER 913

The road that crosses the town towards the government office.

At the unexpected commotion, anxious eyes appear between the cracks in the door of the thatched house and look outside.

Only the little ones, who still didn't know the fear of the waves or the burden of the world, came out occasionally, casting curious glances.

A child half-hiding behind a thin fence made of reeds.

"[Eek, can't you come in quickly?]"

The mother is startled, hugs the child, and hurriedly disappears into the thatched cottage.

In the midst of all this, the face of the child stretching his neck over his mother's shoulder.

The skin was sallow, the cheeks that should have been firm and firm were sunken and thin, the lips were swollen, and the hair was also dull and lacking in shine, revealing the scalp that was sparse and yellow.

He is the epitome of a filthy child who has not been able to eat.

When I first saw you, our Jayeo was exactly like that.

And soon, on the other side, the local government office of Joseon Province, called Dongheon to be exact, appears.

This is the symbol of Dongheon, the outer gate.

The outer gate is a main gate on the first floor, and the second floor is an open space with no walls and a banquet hall. It is built on pillars and has a tiled roof on top.

On this floor, out of nowhere, there was a large drum. This drum was the famous Sinmungo, the drum that was supposed to be rung when the people suffered injustice.

But even though everyone was so hungry and resentful that they had become like monsters, instead of the sound of drums, all that could be heard was the leisurely yet eerie trembling sound of stringed instruments.

Hahaha, kkwaarur, the joyful laughter coming from the banquet hall on the second floor of the outer gate.

Sniff sniff, the unique, light, oily scent of chicken broth, boiled until the bones melt, gently wafts into Qing's nose.

The center of Qing's forehead is split open.

Here, these monster robbers have abandoned their human form and are out to commit robbery. At the government office, they are not even inside, but on top of the gate, playing music and eating and drinking, and they are having a good time.

It is even more shocking that this situation was set up while the entire town was starving, and there were not even soldiers to guard the area below.

No, you're saying they're sons of bitches so openly?

Qing looks up at the outer gate with a bewildered expression, then turns around and examines the faces of the group of monsters.

Embarrassment, anger, and resignation were all mixed together, but there was no sign of surprise, so it was a familiarity that something like this had happened more than once or twice.

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTOHRORERRcHo0c25XOUMyZkxrdUFVTG4vc2cxbHhHRnljQlhSZXVxVFRXaQ

"Huh, the managers are like dogs. I thought the Zhongyuan were the best, but Joseon guys are pretty good too."

Even the blood cultist Gangthalma was amazed, so how could it be?

Qing dismounts from his horse and gestures to the group of monsters.

"[Okay, follow me quietly. I'm going to have to really break those kids' heads today.]"

Qing strides up the stairs in the corner below the outer gate.

In one breath, he went to the banquet hall above the outer gate. Originally, it was called Numaru, a place where a newspaper store was kept and edicts were announced, but since a banquet was being held right now, it would not be wrong to call it a banquet hall.

Men sitting cross-legged on cushions, women each flanking them, and tables of food placed in front of them.

In the midst of all this, Qing's eyes quickly scanned the individual side dishes, and, um, without realizing it, my eyes went to the side dishes first...

Chicken soup with a few yellow jeon, tofu, white kimchi, garaetteok, and honey and soy sauce jeon, it's a rather simple set of side dishes.

A group of thieves who set out to make a living are nothing but bones and skeletons, while the high-ranking officials are drinking alcohol with food prepared, and while they are drinking alcohol with women and playing the geomungo or gayageum or something else.

Well, beast, you passed very well.

Even though they were having so much fun, they didn't notice until Qing came up and a horde of monsters started to come in behind them.

"[Wow!]"

"[What, what is this, where am I!]"

A few people sitting farthest from the table suddenly stand up and point their fingers at Qing.

In the midst of all this, the guys sitting in the middle are just looking at each other arrogantly, pretending to be polite. It's really absurd.

"What are you doing, Jang Jeong? Get him out right now-"

Deung! The majestic sound of the temple bell rings out of nowhere.

At the same time, a pillar of the loft suddenly disappeared, revealing a fierce cross-section torn apart vertically.

The sound of everyone's head turning towards the pillar they had left behind, then looking at the sky, then back at the pillar, and then swallowing loudly.

"[Anyone else have something to say?]"

Those who keep their mouths shut about it.

"[I am Ximen Qing from the Zhongyuan. I was going on a tour of Jangbaek when a group of monsters blocked my path, demanding my horse and robbing me. I repelled them and rebuked them, and they told me it was your officials who ordered me to do this. I am truly an unworthy warrior, but even so, I believe that the leader of a bandit gang is far better off dead than alive. Isn't that the same for the world?]"

The faces of the officials and village chiefs turned pale.

It means that the most active players messed with the wrong people.

In the Zhongyuan, there is a force called the Murim, who are said to learn miraculous martial arts without even asking for permission from the country.

"[So, you in the middle, you are the highest. Do you have any excuses?]"

"[There's a misunderstanding, there seems to be a misunderstanding. Those gangsters aren't from our town. We've been trying to subdue them for a while, but they're so elusive that we haven't been able to catch them. Even now, we'll send soldiers to hunt them down and capture them all—]"

"[Oh, you don't know? I heard that's the case?]"

"[I, I……!]" "[That bastard Yuk Sil-heul!]" "[That bastard is the magistrate!]"

A group of monsters start pointing fingers and hurling insults at him, turning on their twin flames.

The magistrate's expression suddenly hardened.

"Shut up! How dare you, you rascals, insult an adult! Do you really want to die?!"

Oh, strong, weak, weak, strong.

You were just being sarcastic in front of me, but look how you got angry right away when the monsters cursed at you.

Then, shockingly, the group of monsters suddenly shut their mouths and shrug their shoulders.

Well, that can't be helped.

If you are oppressed by violence from any authority or power for a long time, you will lose the will to resist and will only continue to feel intimidated.

If that was the case even in the Qing's homeland, what would it be like in this primitive ancient society with its more pronounced class differences?

"[Stop it. The people are starving to the point of skin and bones, yet they resort to robbery to survive, while you officials, with your women, eat delicious food, and hold drinking parties—]"

"The Madichi is so chewy, it feels like chewing on cheesecloth. No matter how much I chew, it's still the same, and my jaw hurts. Ah, it's so bitter."

Gongryang Sa-yoon, who was holding a bowl of chicken stew and mumbling, added some useless comments.

Qing just pretended not to hear.

"[-You are alive but do nothing and instead cause harm, so it would be better for you not to exist in the world than to be alive.]"

"[This, this is Joseon's business!]"

"[This is Joseon's business? Then, should we consider it a matter of Joseon and the Zhongyuan? Joseon officials are using their people to harm the people of the Zhongyuan? This is called PungQing, isn't it?"

The magistrate's expression becomes even paler.

The Jungwon people were a people who valued their reputation very much, so if it became public knowledge, they would absolutely not be able to let it go, even for the sake of reputation.

Even though he was a county magistrate, he was just one of countless local officials. If the Zhongyuan were to become angry, the court would immediately try to appease him by offering him his head.

"[That, that's not it, that, that, that, that man! This Choi really made a big mistake!]"

The magistrate immediately struck him in the head.

It seems that he has finally realized that he will die no matter what, and his determination to bow down immediately is quite remarkable.

But after coming this far, I couldn't just say, "Okay, let's do our best," and leave.

The chances of him suddenly reforming and becoming a government official with a spirit of love for the people are extremely slim, and if he leaves like this, the hordes of monsters who came up believing in the Qing will suffer proper retaliation.

So what?

I'm not sorry at all, but it's better for the world and for me if the one who's going to die dies.

Look at all those evil deeds, compared to those officials in the Zhongyuan, they were really good and upright officials, really.

The corners of his lips twitched in a smile.

"[Then, let's do this. I'll give you a riddle, and if you can guess it, I'll forget this ever happened.]"

"[Interpersonal-]"

"[Now, what kind of duck is a duck that can't fly? Guess what.]"

It seems like the sound of someone's head spinning is echoing in his head.

In the midst of all this, as the magistrate kept giving hints here and there, the sound of heads rolling seemed to grow louder and more intense.

After a while like that.

"[It seems like no one has solved it. The answer is-]"

"[Wait a minute! I understand! I understand! A duck is a duck, but a duck that can't fly! Isn't that a corrupt official duck? A corrupt official duck!]"

For a moment, Qing stops moving.

The hordes of monsters exchange glances with each other.

Do you think it's right? I think it's right. I think it's right.

"madam."

Qing scratches the back of his head.

What kid doesn't know how to read the mood?

He turns his head and sees a horse-headed man with a goatee looking at him with hopeful eyes.

"[Nari, you're a corrupt official, aren't you?]"

"[Indeed, a corrupt official! That's right! A corrupt official!]"

Corrupt officials who giggle as if they were alive.

Qing sighed deeply.

"[Wrong.]"

"[Yes? Your Majesty, but a duck is a duck, but a duck that can't fly. Isn't that a corrupt official's duck?]"

"[That's not my answer.]"

"[Well, Your Majesty, isn't it the law of the land that if a riddle makes sense, it should be considered the correct answer…….]"

"[Because it doesn't make sense in the first place.]"

The group of monsters exchanged glances again.

Do you think it's raining? It seems like it's raining. I think it's raining.

"[That doesn't make sense. A duck is a duck, but it can't fly. A corrupt official can't fly, so this should also be considered correct.]"

"[Corrupt officials can fly.]"

"[yes?]"

"[They say that corrupt officials can fly.]"

"[Yes, how can a corrupt official fly? That's nonsense, ugh.]"

The guy who was talking back as if he was being wronged starts to groan and struggle.

Well, that's because Qing, who had suddenly come forward like a ghost, grabbed him by the collar and lifted him up.

And then, suddenly, a loud noise!

"Even a corrupt duck can fly! Because! Ducks can fly!"

"[Cough, what, what-]"

"[Go! Even a corrupt official can fly! Soar! Up in the sky! I want to be a beautiful moon! Nothing is impossible in this world!]

Qing grabs the bastard's collar tightly with both hands.

Spin around using the front foot as the axis.

Stepping forward on your hind legs, you circle again.

The sound of footsteps was loud, and the rotation was as fast as the speed, and then it spun around fiercely-

"[Now! Fly! Dreams! Come True!]"

With a loud shout, he throws it high into the sky with a great movement.

"Ahhhh!!"

The sight of something flying in a gentle diagonal line close to a straight line.

Corrupt officials, fly!

Aaaa ...

The magistrate's screams quickly fade away.

Qing shakes his hands and turns around.

Aaaah ...

The screams from behind are getting closer again.

Even though I helped him so much, it seems he couldn't fly for long.

But it still flew, right? It flew, right?

While the county magistrate, the local officials, and the landowners looked at Qing with pale faces-

Behind the blue hand that was being flicked, in the distance, a human figure was falling down.


CHAPTER 914

Silence falls on the numaru.

But that was only for a moment.

"[Who's the real monster here? Those lowly bastards, the heads of households who, even if they're ridiculously disguised as monsters, are trying to provide for their families, or are you, who wear human skin and suck the blood of others?]"

A certain color that shines faintly beyond the cotton thread.

A color that was red like a flower, yellow like an animal's eye, yet shone with the most precious color, purple, and also blue like the sky on a clear day, yet did not resemble any of these colors at all, a color that had never existed in the world.

"[I came down here to defeat the monsters that are wreaking havoc on my land, so what are you doing? I have to defeat the monsters in human form.]"

Qing stretches out her finger.

It was at that moment that the magistrate opened his mouth to protest.

"[Ugh, ugh!]" "[You, you fucking, fucking son of a bitch!]"

A group of monsters gathered on the stairs of the Numaru begin to run at once, wielding clubs.

The room was now filled with only sounds, the sound of dogs barking, barking, and barking.

The anger of the weak is something that, once it explodes, is already too late.

Because those who cannot express their anger in the face of the wall of reality even when faced with something that should make them angry in the first place are usually called weak.

But when that accumulated anger, that pent-up and tightly packed anger, breaks open the lid and bursts out, a backlash equal to the density of the pressure follows.

So the rage of the monster horde, the most playful gang, exploded in a mighty stream like an erupting volcano, like a huge wave surging.

The most popular gang of playful people, who had beaten up the officials and local officials who had been playing and lying down on the pavilion, took advantage of the momentum and took over the Dongheon and defeated the officials.

And the grain storage of Dongheon was opened wide.

"Oh my god, it's all rice, rice!"

"[When you harvest grain, you mix half of it with rice bran and sand, and then you pile up the rice in the warehouse…!]"

"[Isn't this rice flour? These bastards are starving and trying to steam rice cakes while they're still alive, you fucking bastards!]"

The full grain stores only fueled the anger of the starving commoners.

Even if the statement to Qing was exaggerated, it was not made up.

The saying that there was at least one person in every household who starved to death because they couldn't eat was an exaggeration mixed with a joke, but it wouldn't be wrong to say that there was at least one person in every three or four households who starved to death.

If we include those who died from diseases caused by poor nutrition, we can say that there was no exaggeration.

So, what would be the feelings of the most popular group of people when they saw the warehouse full of sacks?

"[This, this is it.]"

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTeTU4d1BCaW1Id0pOZFVrZk1vckQySE1jajU2QnZNQ2N5OGIzZ0h2a2o5Uw

"If only we had this, we would have been well fed until next year's harvest……"

"[If you keep tearing it apart so tenaciously……!]"

The blinded commoners take up their clubs again, and as the sun sets and the darkness of the night approaches, they rush out, holding torches in their other hands.

And so, the sounds of lamentation and the final words of mourners rush in like a storm from the splendid tile-roofed houses of the officials and village heads.

In fact, the Joseon people were never lacking in temperament, so they were the famous Seokjeon people.

The battle of the Zhongyuan is a war fought between villages, with the winner becoming the master and the loser becoming the slave.

This is a war for survival and prosperity.

But what about Joseon's stone tablets?

Stone battle is a game where people throw stones at each other.

It's not war, it's play, a bloody folk game that only real men can play!

So, the original Dongi people are not afraid of seeing blood.

The nobles, the middle class, and their servants fought against the cheerful rebellion of the commoners with their eyes rolled back, but that was all.

The gentleman, whose hair was grabbed, was dragged out with a bruised face.

The young master who was famous for being a thief, the vicious wife who made the servants cry every day, the landowner who acted like a landlord, the high-ranking nobles, and the middle-class people who were not nobles but were exploiting the people are all dragged out, covered in blood and urine.

And so the long night ends.

A deep night with the moon high in the sky.

A village feast was held out of nowhere.

People's expressions are bright, and the smell of cooking rice fills the air.

People who always laugh out loud with bright faces.

But behind that, there was a huge tree with a person hanging from it.

Instead of love, a person hung on the big tree in the middle of the town. It was like a person hanging on a jujube tree, or a person hanging on a jujube tree.

Even in this uncontrollable rage, it seems that Qing's advice to hang him and let him live a long and regretful life instead of killing him in peace was quite impressive.

A feast was being held in front of such a hideous sculpture, and to anyone who saw it, it would have looked like an evil banquet held by a cult of the powerful and the weak.

However, Qing didn't really care.

Originally, it was a Qing that did not consider those less than human as human, so it was all about karma.

The robber didn't even care.

Of course, the leader of the Blood Cult would care about such things.

I didn't even care about the public opinion.

It's human work for non-humans, you know.

Lu Bu didn't care either.

A beast is a beast for nothing.

Therefore, a midnight feast took place that no one questioned.

"[Okay, the monk should also receive a reward!]"

"Oh. Um……."

Naturally, a well-prepared meal was also delivered to the leader of this historic people's liberation, the liberation fighter from the Zhongyuan, Monk Samjang.

Tofu, soy sauce, kimchi, and a variety of other ingredients in a meat soup. A heaping heap of roughly sliced boiled pork.

And lots and lots of rice.

A large bowl of rice, big enough to serve as a soup bowl, piled high, um, if it were home-style, it would be enough for four, no, five bowls of rice… …

In fact, even before entering the martial arts world, Qing was a typical side dish slayer who ate little rice and a lot of side dishes. Well, well, rice is still good.

But the kimchi, the kimchi, the color is totally, this is a bit. My kimchi isn't like this! Ugh!

The original Joseon kimchi that I was looking for was something made of cabbage, dark in color and full of bones.

And the boiled pork, um, the gamey smell is amazing.

Although Qing did not know, this was an inevitable problem with the Joseon pig breed.

This is why Joseon people had to ban beef from the country (even though they ignored it and ate it grilled and grilled), and why pork had to be cooked by boiling or stewing.

But still, Joseon, not my Joseon, but the Joseon folk cuisine that I had high expectations for, was the moment when it betrayed the Qing.

Well, hometown cuisine and Joseon cuisine are completely different, of course that's true...

It was a moment when Qing was slightly depressed.

If they were Qing's friends, they would not have been able to hide their surprise at seeing Qing looking so gloomy at the dinner table.

Where does it hurt? No, it looks like it hurts a lot, but the expression on his face as he sat down at the table said, "If it hurts, don't hold it in, tell me." That's the general reaction.

Anyway, in the meantime.

"[Look, Master Samjang, didn't you say that you were Ximen Qing from the Zhongyuan?]"

Qing raises his head.

A scholar wearing a hat.

However, it wasn't like there were only bastards among the nobles, and among them there were some who didn't incur resentment.

It is said that he was a scholar who lived comfortably receiving grain even though he did not have to do any work because his family tree was of the yangban class, and that he shared the grain he received with the commoners in his neighborhood.

Perhaps because he was such a person, he might not have taken up an official position and instead just sat at home reading.

Why, you said the country was doing well.

"[I'm asking because I wonder if you have any insight into what to do in the future.]"

"[from now on?]"

"[What is happening now is clearly a rebellion. And what dynasty, if not ours, would tolerate a rebellion? Surely an army would rush in to suppress it? How will you respond to this?"

Isn't that also the case of the strict caste system that was the foundation of Joseon, where noble nobles and middle class people were hung up by the commoners, commoners and slaves, and their wealth was plundered?

Even Joseon's caste system was particularly strict.

If a commoner kills a nobleman, the local magistrate is immediately dismissed, the status of the town is lowered, and even the name of the town is changed.

Is that all?

They even went so far as to block the people of that village from taking the civil service examination, calling it the hometown of traitors and traitorous town.

Of course, burying nobles was quite common, so if they didn't get caught, it was a jackpot. The Dongyi people's true fear was that they secretly buried them.

Even if there is a realistic and convincing excuse, it ends with saying that the tiger bit him.

However, it is not possible to blame all these officials and local officials on the tiger.

"[Well, in my opinion, wouldn't it be better to say that Ximen Qing, a person from the Zhongyuan, brought a group of robbers disguised as monsters and wiped them out?]"

"Will that work?"

"[So you have to be careful with your words.]"

"I don't understand. That's just a play on words. And their lives are at stake over such a shallow play on words. The Dharma Master may have helped them out of goodwill, but isn't that ultimately putting them in even greater trouble?

"[Huh, if you see someone drowning, you should save them, right? But after you save them, do you have to live with them for the rest of your life and take responsibility for them?]"

"[What does it mean?]"

"[If we had just left them alone? Wouldn't they have continued to steal to avoid starvation anyway? How long would that stealing last? If you mess with a master, they'll be wiped out. Even if they weren't true masters like me, wouldn't they have easily been wiped out by lesser masters?]"

Qing stirs the meat soup while answering nonchalantly.

And then the intestines, um, this is intestine soup, um, isn't it soup? Naejangtang? But why do all the side dishes smell so fishy? Is it the problem of the boiled intestines?

"[And how long can we guarantee that the Zhongyuan or the Jurchens will tolerate the hordes of monsters that keep provoking them? If the army comes, a whole town will be decimated. How can running wild, unaware of the future, be any different from a drowning man?]"

"[…….]"

"[How could they possibly be such good-natured people in the first place? Even if they say it's for survival, aren't they ultimately thieves? Even if it's understandable that they kill others to survive, the notoriety of the most famous playboys is already well-known, so what kind of heinous acts are they committing? Tsk tsk.]"

The scholar lowers his head as if embarrassed.

Even if it was an inevitable choice due to the tyranny of the ruling class, robbery was still robbery.

"[But the ones who actually fill their stomachs are different. If you really want to cut them, you should cut the stomachs of those who exploit you. Why should you live by cutting the stomachs of people who are having a hard time just like you?]"

Isn't there a saying in your hometown too?

You got slapped in Jongno, and, uh, where was it? You got spit on in Yongsan? Was it Yongsan? Samgakji? Itaewon? Ilsan? No, was it somewhere far away? Then, Pyongyang? But was it really spitting? Was it really slapped in Jongno in the first place? Miss, I can barely remember my hometown language anymore.

But since there's no way to know now, Miss, why should I just think about it and end up feeling awkward without knowing? Hmm? No, isn't that right? The language of my hometown is Joseon?

"[Hey, what was that proverb, getting slapped in Jongno, and then what?]"

"[It must mean that after getting slapped in Jongno, you go to the Han River and get glared at.]"

Curiosity satisfied!

Qing nodded.

"[Yes. Anyway, if you've been slapped in Jongno, you should return the favor to Jongno. What good is it to cause damage to the Han River? This is a case of Joseon officials failing to look after their own people. Even if it means shedding blood, it's their responsibility to see it through.]"

So whatever the outcome, this is right.

If the Joseon officials were abusive and forced out, then it would be right to point the sword at those Joseon officials, not to live off the Manchu Arasa slash-and-burn farmers in the Zhongyuan who were in the same difficult situation.

The monster horde is pitiful, but just because they are pitiful and weak doesn't mean they are kind.


CHAPTER 915


Dunhua, a city in Manchuria.

Considering that the people living in Manchuria were Jurchens and nomads, the sight of a city with thick-walled houses might seem out of place.

But if you consider that the current Jurchen people are a mixture of nomads who wander around with their houses and sedentary people who have built houses and settled down, it is not so strange.

The land of Manchuria was constantly changing hands, having been ruled by the Han Chinese, Dongyi Chinese, Malgal Chinese, Khitan Chinese, and even Mongol Chinese, making it a land where many customs were mixed.

So, money!

Excluding the windows, the thick reinforced exterior walls made of mud or bricks are also an architectural characteristic unique to cold regions.

And the fact that the houses are not very large is also a characteristic of cold neighborhood architecture.

So, the house standing at the corner of Donghwa was just a Yeojin house with an ordinary appearance and nothing special about it.

But the inside was different.

The walls were lined with gold silk, and a luxurious bed in the style of a Jurchen house, completely out of place, was brought in. The walls of the house were all torn down to create a room, and the interior was lavishly decorated with all kinds of porcelain and mother-of-pearl.

And then a woman comes into the house and frowns at the flashy sight.

"Did you call? But, every time I see you, I feel like you're completely shallow. A nouveau riche trying to show off his wealth? That's the feeling, ugh."

A wedge, an apple cuts through the air.

It was a straight fastball.

Pfft. The woman who was hit by the flying apple falls to the ground.

No, did I just curl up?

Even if it's an apple, if it's thrown by a skilled person, it becomes a terrifying weapon. The woman lying on the floor had her neck bent at an impossible angle, and her head, which was completely attached to her back, was lying on top of her torso, causing her to tremble and convulse.

It was a truly horrific sight, but the young man, who had only raised his upper body from the bed, simply frowned.

"You monster, how dare you open your mouth without permission."

And then he clicks his tongue and says, "Tsk."

"Stop joking around and get up, you monster."

A joke? How can you call it a joke when you see someone lying with their head on the back of their neck, bent backwards?

however-

"Shut up."

The body that was convulsing gave a rebound that hit the legs and then the pelvis, and then got up.

The back of the head is attached to the back, so when viewed from the front, it is just a headless torso.

But that was only for a moment, now he lifted his broken head with both arms and tilted it left and right to settle down.

Crunch, crunch, the sound of bones interlocking.

"Ah. Ah. Ah? Ah~, is this going to be difficult? Even if you're not dying, you're saying it hurts?"

"You monster don't even know pain."

"It's heartbreaking, Magun."

"Call me Demon King, you monster."

"Wow, aren't you ashamed to call yourself the Demon King, and the Demon King 'nim' at that? Isn't that just the kind of delusion only kids would have? I am the Shikishim Shikishim. The great Shikishim Shikishim, my achievements include devouring people. Phew."

Then the young man, Shikshimmagun, reaches straight to the bedside table.

Then the woman said, "Pfft!"

"Wait! If I die again, I'll have to go see my master too. Are you going to be without a messenger again? Well, if that's what you want."

The woman spreads out both arms.

"I'll die once more, both to take a vacation and to see my master's face. Okay, I'm ready to die!"

The demon king stopped in his tracks.

"You fucking monster."

"At least that monster doesn't eat its own kind, so I guess I'll just have to be a monster. But."

The woman smiles happily at the sight of her single son.

"I'm telling you this because I can't kill you anyway. You said, Master, that human desires stem from what they lack most. So, the reason the Demon Lord is so obsessed with nobility and luxury is because, to begin with, he's a particularly lowly beggar. Oh, please bear with this?"

The demon king quietly ground his teeth at that.

It is not an immortal monster or one that will not die, so if you treat it roughly, it will return to its owner and have to be repaired.

It is a monster that can transmit sound across ten thousand li using its mysterious sound tube, so it is not something that can be removed just because it is annoying.

Once you get used to the convenient Cheonumtong communication, you can no longer be satisfied with the slow human communication.

The cunning monster knows this, so she becomes especially angry when her spare life is at stake.

"Do you think I don't know your true intentions? And that that sinister, rascally bitch is secretly encouraging you monsters to act?"

"Hehe, isn't that something you should say to your precious daughter's benefactor? You eat people and don't know anything about grace, and yet you keep saying "monster, monster, monster" at the end of every word. It's so annoying."

The woman gives a sinister smile.

Shiksimmagun is about to cry, but barely manages to hold back his anger.

At some point, the monster's provocations began to go overboard. It was probably after his daughter suffered the humiliation of that rip-and-tear sword.

It seems that he feels that he owes his master a great debt, so he puts up with the ambiguous attitude of the gangster girl and her secretly uncooperative behavior while pretending to follow her.

If it weren't for him, I would have killed that suspicious woman a long time ago.

"Okay. What about the princess? Is that swordsman still here?"

Then, the woman continued muttering to herself.

"Ah. Wait a minute. Sayoon, Sayoon, can you hear me? If you can hear me, can you shake the carrot?"

"No carrots? Then what do you have? What is it, beef jerky? Wow, beef jerky? Delicious. Oh, I said there aren't any..."

"Yeah. Yeah. I can't always do it. But I survive because of our youngest, yeah. So, what about the Sword Master? Did you catch the princess?"

"Oh, I see. That's not important. So, hehe, I want to see it too. Yeah. But, that's okay, ah! Hehe, I'll do that."

The woman who had been talking to herself like she was possessed by a ghost loses her bright smile.

Instead, what takes its place is a scornful, scornful, and eerie smile.

The woman opens her mouth.

"Your Majesty, please speak. Ahem, ahem, ah, I have some important personal business to attend to. I'm sorry, but please leave the princess to Hyung Yoo."

The Siksimma Army took this.

"You monster bitch, you act so arrogant to me, but you're so polite to that swordsman?"

"Oh, are you angry? But, that monster bitch is rude, but Sayoon's close friend is polite."

"It's funny. You think he's kind to monsters like you, but you're mistaken. He's a selfish, indifferent bastard who cares for no one but himself. He just pretends to be kind because it's convenient."

"Even if you pretend to be kind, where's that? Can't the Demon Lord at least pretend?"

"Why me? Only those who lack strength use kindness to seduce others. A truly strong person doesn't need to worry about what others think."

"Huh? The Demon Lord is watching the mood of the Lord."

The tendon on Shiksimmagun's forehead flared up!

A voice full of poison flows out.

"You monster. I'm only keeping you alive because it's convenient for you-"

"By the way, the personal matter you mentioned, Master Geomma, is to receive martial arts training from Cheonhwageom. I heard Cheonhwageom is currently heading to Baekdu Mountain."

The woman cuts off the horse of the Siksimma-gun.

"Are you going to seek revenge on that hated Cheonhwageom, or are you going to deal with the princess to follow the orders of the Hweju?"

At that, Shikshimma-kun clenched his teeth.

----

Daeho was a mountain range of the state.

Of course, Daeho is unaware that he is called Sangun, and he is also unaware that his territory is called a state spirit by the prey.

The only thing that matters to the beast is that the nearby mountainside is its territory.

And the prey that lives huddled together underneath are truly ferocious.

So, unless the tiger was extremely hungry, it rarely went down to the prey's den.

Because, if you wait around the bare, grassy area without any trees on the mountainside, there will be times when prey will pass by on its own.

Exactly, just like now.

The tiger's eyes shine from above the tree.

The prey coming up from below.

Three two-legged fierce ones, one four-legged tasty one.

The tiger's gaze lingers on the four-legged creature.

The ferocious ones are good for filling the stomach because there are many of them, but the intestines are empty and the taste is not good.

But the internal organs of a four-legged creature are truly fantastic, to the point of making one's tail stand on end.

The cunning tiger slowly lowers its body.

The two-legged ones should be released to slaughter their young, and the four-legged ones should be used to prey on them. The tiger drooled thickly at the prospect.

So, as the prey approaches.

The tiger leaps down with graceful movements, opening its mouth wide and letting out a loud breath.

Then, as always, the two-legged ones will run away in fear, and the four-legged ones will freeze in surprise… …

Of course, not everything in the world goes according to a beast's prediction.

"Huh? What, another tiger? Why are there so many tigers?"

"Do wild boars and deer not appear? Tigers are tasteless."

"Gorani, that tasted good."

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTL3dYeTNMdUZMY2tBbDRJUTA3dTBqU0tVeUxlbTZ0YVl1SU5HSDNUSC9Fcw

-Purrrrrr.

The prey cries calmly.

Daeho is speechless.

This is because, although two-legged prey sometimes did this, there was no case of them being ignored by four-legged ones.

Well, Lu Bu, who has four legs, is not afraid of tigers at all.

In the first place, wasn't it true that horses trained as warhorses were of a modified breed that had their original timid instincts killed, and among them, wasn't it Lu Bu who was particularly intelligent?

The tiger's master's rank is much higher than the tiger's, and the tiger, carrying its master, can be seen as having the same rank as its master.

The tiger, with its pride wounded, threatens with the low-frequency sound characteristic of a wild beast.

Grrrrr… …!

The sight of a large tiger showing its yellow teeth and growling would be so frightening that it would make an ordinary person wet their pants without realizing it, right?

But Qing is a master.

Even when I was a child, I was never afraid of tigers.

"Should I do it? Or you, sir?"

"The knife gets dirty. If you put a scaffolding on it, it takes ages just to clean it."

"Well, I guess there's nothing I can do about it. Hmm."

Deeng… …! Along with that, the sound of a huge temple bell.

It was the last sound the tiger heard alive.

and?

When a tiger dies, it leaves behind its skin, and when a tiger dies, it also leaves behind its meat.

The farmers in this area were also very concerned, so they were catching and handing over any tigers they saw.

But tiger meat was tasteless… … .

The meat was eaten to the full by the hungry slash-and-burn farmers, and its skin became the robe of the great monk Tripitaka and hung on his shoulders.

"[I am the Great Guardian King Ximen Qing! The tears of you pitiful beings have called me to your throne, so I will satisfy you with the same amount of tears! All you monsters of the world, follow this monk, Tripitaka!"

The king of the monsters, with his face covered and wearing a lion's pelt, raised his sword high, and all the monsters rushed out and followed him, chanting her name.

"[Wow! The Great Tiger! The Great Tiger!]" "[Ssamjang! Ssamjang!]" "[You bastards, I'll kill you all!]"

If you only say whether it is the Great Tiger King or the Tripitaka, there will be no confusion, but both the Great Tiger King and the Tripitaka were born, and that was Ximen Qing.

Because this was the answer of the scholar of PungQing-ri.

'[I dare ask you, then, could you please punish the corrupt officials in this area as well?]'

In fact, to be honest, it is better for the local officials and local officials to die from the government's perspective.

The force that the current government regards as the most troublesome and seeks to destroy is the local aristocrats, or hyangni.

The people the court was most wary of were the middle class and local officials who had gained great power by taking advantage of the weakened control of the court during the Imjin War.

So these days, when local farmers are beaten to death by local farmers, they tend to ignore it.

The problem is the local officials.

Under national law, he should be punished with a very severe penalty, but that's that, and there was a benefit to it.

The local officials who were dispatched are most likely those who bought their positions with bribes and then act even more cruelly in an attempt to get their money back.

That is, if the local official dies early, the position can be sold for money again!

It's quite a welcome development for the powers that be in the court.

however?

Since the Japanese invasions of Korea, Joseon has still been short of people, with one person missing.

So, if you want to make a splash, you have to make a big splash.

A single town's rebellion could be burned down and used as an example, but it would be a truly burdensome task to wipe out several towns, especially those on the border.

then?

"[receipt.]"

For that reason.

A ghost is wandering around Joseon.

A ghost named Ximen Qing.

To hunt down the corrupt officials of Joseon, that is, the governors, local officials, and landowners who covet the blood and sweat of the people, ghosts made a secret pact with the people.

Corrupt officials… … Omitted.


PART 92 The Weirdo, the Weirdo, and the Weirdo
Reference to 2008's Korean Movie 'The Good, the Bad, the Weird'

CHAPTER 916

From the middle of the border of Pyeongan Province to halfway up the border of Hamgyong Province, countless towns were engulfed in bloodshed due to the untimely anger of the people.

In terms of the Qing Dynasty's hometown, it could be said that this was an explosion of anger a hundred years before the rebellion of a fallen nobleman with the surname Hong (not Hong Gil-dong) in this area.

However, there were some ambiguous points in the Joseon Dynasty government's definition of this as a civil unrest.

It cannot be called a civil war because the people did not unite and march on the capital city or form an independent military force.

The scale and number of cases would be too large to be considered a model town.

Even if those parties claim that I don't know anything about it, that a robber from the Zhongyuan called Ximen Qing came riding a black horse, immediately killed the officials and local officials, and looted the granaries and distributed the money to the people.

"Got it? As the newcomer said, it's the Zhongyuan bandit Ximen Qing. You must never call me a newcomer or a monk. Otherwise, we'll all be annihilated."

"I don't know if that's okay. But you're a rookie and a benefactor, so how can you do that?"

"Isn't the God of Destiny saying that He will open a path for us to live? Even if we only offer our gratitude in our hearts, the God of Destiny will fully understand."

"Oh, but still."

"If that's true, why don't we build a shrine and make offerings to him? After all, he's a god."

It was a moment when a previously non-existent folk religion began to sprout in northern Joseon.

Of course, in this era, faith was not something grand.

In the list of gods such as Heaven, Buddha, Maitreya, Mountain God, and Ancestor, only Samjang or Ximen were added.

Meanwhile, in the villages of slash-and-burn farmers who were hiding from the government, it is said that such a punishment of corrupt officials did not occur.

But it was a time of great hunger and anxiety for everyone.

It was not only humans who were hungry, so they all felt great gratitude towards the god who had killed the tiger and given them its meat and bones.

From now on, these anecdotes will become folktales and spread. What's this? You too? Us too. If we all come together, thinking, "You're all new," we might be able to form a single, powerful thread.

Maybe not. Or maybe not.

Anyway.

The liberator of eight counties, the savior of fifteen slash-and-burn villages, the new god who came to illuminate the dark Joseon and the adversary of the demons wearing the human skull, has finally discovered the whereabouts of the new ghost teacher.

It was fairly certain information that Master Shingwi was living in seclusion beneath the majestic mountains southeast of Baekdu Mountain.

What's a pity is that it's only seven days. It's a concept that doesn't exist in the Zhongyuan yet, but in the Qing homeland's way, it would have been nice to have known about it just a week earlier.

If that were the case, the martial arts master wouldn't have had to steal the Talmyungjeongsim, or rather, the Juche Jajusimgong...

Of course, even if I had wandered around Baekdu Mountain without bothering to find information in Joseon, there would have been no guarantee that I would find it before April.

Yes, today is the first day of April.

Anyway, the promised spring month had finally arrived, and as soon as the first day of the month dawned, the robbers started to cause a ruckus, saying they would pounce.

And so, it is a scene of innocent destruction of nature.

After pouring out all his martial arts skills, he split trees, broke rocks, and dug a hole in the ground.

"No, sir. Why are you so sullen? I just taught you how to do it, and this is a perfectly good technique."

Talmyungdo, or rather, the method of self-directed learning, is just a mediocre (not so good) martial art with a red border, but Talmyungjeongsim, the method of self-directed learning, is a golden, golden bordered internal energy method.

From the golden border, it is a study that is absolutely not lacking in hearing the sound of divine power.

If the study of the mind of self-reliance were to appear somewhere, it could cause a storm of blood to blow through the martial world, just like the time of the absorption magic attack.

"I'd know it if I heard it. It's a divine skill. Of course, even when eating martial arts food, I ate a lot more than you. No, the food I left over was more than what you ate, um. No, considering you don't usually eat that much, um, maybe similar."

"But why do you look like that?"

But the robber's expression was bitter.

Just like when you chew codfish salad and the bitterness of doraji salad lingers, or when you chew sweet and sour pork and realize it's sweet and sour pork, the chewy texture of shiitake mushroom soup lingers.

"I told you last time. I've reached this level and I'm not going to change my mind method. I'm not trying to learn. But since you've called me your disciple, you should at least throw me a piece of meat to save my reputation as a teacher. Hey, I finally got it right, but I can't even eat it."

That's why I was able to convey it with more ease than other martial arts techniques.

"But what are you planning to do?"

"What?"

"Whether it's a ghost or a spirit, it's a bloodthirsty demon. Do you think you'll just surrender your martial arts skills just because I'm looking for you?"

"Well, if I squeeze and tease him a bit, won't he vomit it out?"

"Ha, if I could have just meekly extracted martial arts like that, I would have already advanced a step forward with countless divine arts by now."

"A hungry man digs a well-"

"Why dig a well when you're hungry? What if you're thirsty?"

"Just get the gist of it. Isn't it the same for you, elders? Honestly, you don't expect much, but you try because you need it and you desperately want it."

The robber sighs deeply at that.

"Even if it doesn't work out, don't be unnecessarily disappointed. It might be different when you're roughly at the peak, but once you're already in the grip of the demon, neither words nor torture will work."

"hmm."

"Well, as you say, it's not something a guy called a robber should say, but if you're desperate, you should at least try. With your skills, you should be able to defeat even the most infamous of them without killing them. Surely a guy with a bad reputation on a remote mountainside like this isn't a peerless master of the thieving talisman?"

The expression on his face suddenly turned sour.

"Oh, my. Sigh. Are you going to say something so unlucky? Words can become seeds, I thought, and that's when I ran into you, old man. I never thought Hyun-kyung would dare to attack me."

"So what if the reverse blood demon is a master of de-escaping? Even if there's only one demon in the real world, he won't lose."

"Oh, really?"

"Don't worry, I'll help you as much as I can. Just give me one useful martial art."

"No, what good does that do? He's just a ronin, a swordsman."

"Where in the world is there a free lunch?"

"You are truly a martial arts ghost, a martial arts ghost."

Qing tsk tsk.

Of course, that doesn't mean that a real monster from Talma is waiting for you.

To begin with, wasn't Talma a monster among monsters, one half step ahead of Hyun-kyung?

I don't know if power creates light, but in this primitive, ancient, pseudo-martial arts world, power creates money and power.

If you are a master of the horse riding, you can make a living by establishing your territory in the golden land of the Zhongyuan and receiving a torrent of tribute money.

If someone goes into a mine and comes out, they're probably crazy from the start, so they'll just pluck them out without even noticing.

But would such a master hide so well that he could hear the strange sounds of Baekdu Mountain and practice?

That guy who has mastered magic really does that.

In the first place, the fact that he was hiding in this remote Baekdu Mountain is, at best, a level of a demon, and he learned the Pacheonyeokhyeolsusimjacheomgyeol, one of the ten best magic techniques in the world, so wouldn't it be right to see that he was locked up for fear of becoming a martial arts master?

And it's just a matter of mouth.

In front of the Transcendent Flower Sutra and the Transcendent Heavenly Flower Sword, you are nothing more than a candle in the wind and a mound beneath Mount Tai.

So, the villain of Baekdu Mountain? What's there to be afraid of? Just laugh it off.

Mount Baekdu, or Mount Baekdu, is surprisingly one of the world's largest volcanoes.

Among the mountains, there are many mountains larger and wider than Baekdu, but among volcanoes, there are only two that are larger than Baekdu.

If we consider only the part that is above the water in a barrel that is half-submerged in seawater, Baekdu Mountain could be climbed second.

But if we're going to be that picky, Baekdu Mountain is also the sum of the other peaks in the vicinity and the size of the volcano, so it's hard to say how big it is, so let's do it three times! Three times is high, right?

Anyway, Baekdu Mountain is a very large and tall mountain, so much so that its peak is covered in white ice all year round, or in technical terms, it boasts a magnificent sight of perennial snow.

In other words, early April is not a good time to climb Mt. Baekdu.

The weather is cold, the wind is blowing hard, and the snow is starting to melt.

It's a time when the cold is still cold, but the ground is so muddy that your feet sink in, so you could say that it's a time when the frustration is doubled.

Especially since primitive ancient footwear and undeveloped shoes cannot keep out the moisture from the ground, it is the perfect time to cut off your toes from frostbite by pouring cold on your wet feet.

Of course, it doesn't matter to you.

This level of cold wouldn't dare invade Qing's body, and a person riding a horse didn't have to worry about whether the ground was muddy or dungy.

The robber can endure.

If you are a master of Hyeon-gyeong, you can easily withstand something like Baekdu Mountain in April.

Is it for nothing that Hyun-kyung is called a monster?

Even in the midst of forced marches alternating between revolutions and overnight stays, Gongryang Sa-yoon remained calm and never showed any signs of fatigue. From Qing's perspective, he spoke Korean and seemed to think he was originally from this neighborhood.

Lu Bu had lost a lot of weight.

Still, it seems like he's holding on, even though he's a mixed breed and a famous horse, but, um, maybe I should go down and rest for a bit, at least for that bastard Lu Bu.

So, even in the midst of a forced march through the snowy mountains and forests, the three superhumans, two superhumans (though not Qing) and one jiangshi were able to move around without any particular health problems.

Then finally.

At the southeastern edge of Baekdu Mountain, at the edge of the Gaema Plateau, I discovered a crudely built house in the snow-covered forest.

It was the moment when I came face to face with a figure swinging an axe to chop firewood in front of a cabin in the forest where a cold wind was blowing.

For a moment, awkward glances are exchanged.

It was a look of bewilderment at the unexpected encounter, and also a display of caution to check on the stranger.

The first thing that stands out is the black lines drawn on the exposed face, and the appearance that resembles a cracked rice paddy field, which is so disgusting.

However, it is unclear whether it is a reverse blood demon or not.

The characteristic of the reverse bloodline is that the black blood vessels are bulging out, but the man's skin has black lines running under the skin, not just protruding out.

But, um, but, uhm, but.

Qing thought.

It's a really bad idea, but, um, it's ugly... ... .

Even in this cold weather, the crown of her head is shining brightly without a hat, and the side hair is surprisingly voluminous, so it could be said that her forehead extends beyond the crown of her head.

On the other hand, the area above the eyelids and around the eyebrows is thick and bulging, and the eyes below are flat and the corners of the eyes are droopy.

The nostrils are the size of a soybean, but the nose is the size of a fist.

On the other hand, the lower jaw is extremely protruding, with the upper and lower teeth sticking out so far that it makes you wonder if they will ever meet.

If he was so ridiculously ugly, I would at least feel affection for him, but he is so hideous and disgustingly ugly that even his skin looks like that, so it is at a level that people with a bad stomach wouldn't dare look at him.

Even.

Chin. The man put his chin on the log he was using as a firewood axe, and his head went down about four spans, but his height only decreased by a span.

Because the back is as high as a mountain.

It was called a hunchback, or a hunched back.

Qing was convinced.

It's not that his evil deeds are extremely high, but he failed humans twice, and he's just a miner at first glance.

The Bloodthirsty Mine, finally found!

however?

"[Oh, excuse me. My name is Kim Heo-jung, and I am a practitioner who has left the sword world. But why did your noble lady come all the way to this dangerous place, Jangbaek?]"

"[yes?]"

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTOTFNWHdaUDRWblh2OUIzZzF6azlJblh3U0RLZ3JyUy95cElRM3RsWkhrSA

"[Haha, don't be surprised. I just looked at it briefly and deduced it, it's just my little talent.]"

The hunchback continued.

It was a polite tone of speech that did not match his appearance.

"[Originally, a master rides a horse, and a servant follows him. The horse, though somewhat gaunt, is a world-renowned steed. He has countless warriors armed with weapons as his escort, and maids to attend to him. So, isn't it only natural that he be a noble lady of high status?]"

Suddenly, the mood detective appears.

The title would be something like Hunchbacked Detective Kim Heo-jung.

It's a title I really don't want to read.

Anyway, the voice is truly profound.

The eyes are bright and clear, so there is no cloudy part, and rather, it feels a bit heavy, so you could say that it feels like it was intentionally put on to look cool.

He reflected a little on that.

I think it's a bit early to judge just by appearance.

If the evil deeds are two hundred and twenty, well, it is high, but it is a bit ambiguous to call it a great deed.

So, Qing first tries to be polite.

"I heard a rumor that there is a man named Mr. Shin-Gwi in Jangbaek."

"[Ah, then you've come to the right place. There were people who called me Mr. Shingwi.]"

And then, before Qing could even answer, he continued speaking.

"[Based on my limited ingenuity, I can deduce that if you are wandering this treacherous terrain, you must need a skilled warrior. There must be some reason you cannot find one in this world. Furthermore, you have come forward to defeat a formidable foe, a foe you dare not face. What is this? A family enemy? Or is it a dirty demand from the court? I, Kim Heo-jung, will risk my life for you, young lady. Yes, I will become your strength, your sword.]"

A look of bewilderment lingers on Qing's face.

It was Kim Heo-jung who played the drums and janggu without being asked and took the initiative.

No, I didn't even ask for help, so how can you help me?


CHAPTER 917

"[No, I-]"

"[Okay. It's okay.]"

Kim Heo-jung makes a strange expression.

An expression that could only be described as strange, Qing racked his brain desperately before finally forming a hypothesis, though he was not entirely confident, that perhaps it was a kind expression.

Even though he's so ugly, hmm. I shouldn't keep having such bad thoughts.

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTMzJ6cE1pc3I5S3pIQm93NGg0N0ZJZlpVelVKZ3FwblBJYnIzOHRRUGlEOA

The hunchback nods as if he understands, to Qing, who is speechless at the sight of his incomprehensible, unidentifiable expression and his ugliness that goes beyond the norm.

"[I can already guess from my own deductions that your noble lady must have some difficult circumstances that require her to come in person! I, Kim Heo-jung, am not a man who would pry into the circumstances of a grieving woman. Simply ask for help, and I will be there for you.]"

No, what the hell is that deduction? It's not right at all. And it's deduction, but why is it so burdensomely kind?

"[Aren't you cold? The cold in Gaema is unusual. Even in early spring, it must have been harsh on your majesty. Here, I'll offer you some tea, so please drink it and warm yourself up. Oh, and I'll also prepare some for the servants, so you don't have to worry about it, Miss.]"

Then, as Kim Heo-jung leaves, saying he will boil water, Kangtalma speaks quietly to Qing.

"Since the realm is not visible, it is clear that the mine has entered the mine realm."

When you reach the level of Hyeon-gyeong, you can easily tell at a glance what level is below the highest level, so if you can't see it, it's proof that you're a true master, that is, above the highest level.

"No, it's Mine. He seems like a decent, well-mannered person."

"Are the eyes just for decoration? Look at those eyes, those eyes, those eyes, the way they turn so suddenly, you can tell they're crazy, and if they're crazy, they're definitely crazy. Tsk tsk."

That was the moment.

"[Who just now dared to call me a barbarian?]"

Kim Heo-jung, who was heading to the cabin, suddenly stops and says this, then slowly turns around with a frown on his face.

He already had a crooked face, but now he's frowning, and I'm like, "Wow, my goodness, he's really ugly." I shouldn't keep having such bad thoughts, but no matter how much I look at him, he's still surprisingly uglier and more unique. How can I do that?

"[Miss, you're bringing in a filthy barbarian as your bodyguard. That's not right. There are many excellent masters in the sword world, so why would you hire a lowly, filthy, barbarian-eating scumbag to be your bodyguard?]"

Suddenly the atmosphere is disgusting.

"[No, I thought about it, and even you, Miss, had no choice. If you came all the way here, you must have some truly desperate situation. Surely that damned barbarian knows about it and wants to exploit it?]"

What the hell is that guy's reasoning?

If the reasoning is right, it's amazing, but if it's wrong, there's nothing more ugly than that.

"[Oh, I'm also a barbarian.]"

"[But you are our compatriot. Those Tang idiots with crooked tongues could never imitate your noble Hanyang accent, so it is only natural that you are one of our compatriots. You must have a story to hide. However, you must not do that. Even if you have a story, should a human being imitate a piece of garbage that is less than human? You should call yourself a descendant of the Arasana Geumguk.]"

Kim Heo-jung was the one who couldn't solve even one of that guy's deductions.

Of course, in this case, Kim Heo-jung could have been wronged, because the straight, uninflected pronunciation of the Hanyang gentry was a way of speaking that could only be used by noble families born and raised in Hanyang.

Only then did Qing sympathize with Kangtalma, seeing Kim Heo-jung's sparkling eyes.

Well, the look in his eyes really caught my eye.

His eyes were as shiny as glass beads, filled with an unusual anger that made one wonder if he was the enemy of his parents.

Qing sneaks a peek at him.

"[Hmm. You seem to hate the Zhongyuan people, so if I were one, wouldn't you help me?]"

"[That's, that dirty bastard's bloodline, but, um, um, um.]"

Then, Kim Heo-jung frowned and began to worry.

But, why on earth should you worry?

When the robber speaks in the Zhongyuan dialect, he glares at me as if he's going to kill me, but when I ask him, why does he think long and hard about whether or not to help me?

Why on earth? Qing, too, was lost in thought, so there was a brief moment of silence.

"Ahem, if you've traveled all the way from the Zhongyuan to here, you must have made a very serious decision. It must be a very dangerous task to ask for help from the Geomgye people in this distant land of Joseon."

A fairly fluent Zhongyuan dialect comes out of Kim Heo-jung's mouth.

As he speaks, Kim Heo-jung's eyes regain their luster as if nothing had happened.

Rather, it was a creepy sight. What kind of person's eyes can change so drastically? Is this schizophrenia or something? It was a little creepy.

"If we were to deduce, it would be something that requires an outsider, not a martial arts master, something that martial artists are very reluctant to do. It would be dealing with a powerful enemy that martial artists would not want to incur their resentment against. In that case, it would obviously be dealing with a large group or the imperial palace."

Of course not.

"Either way, it's a chance to kill those rascals who brag about being precious among the party, so it's my pleasure to help you, young lady. So just say the word, and I—not that horrible Zhongyuan bastard! I'll help you!"

It's become more and more difficult to talk because you keep making excuses, so wouldn't it be too strange to say that you came here just to steal the martial arts you've learned?

Still, let's say it out loud first.

Even the robbers who are as strong as a leech and have martial arts skills are incredibly strong these days, so I brought along a master from Hyeon-gyeong.

Thinking about it again, it's truly reassuring. With the best of Hyeon-gyeong on my side, there's nothing to fear in the world.

"That's not it. I came here to learn the martial arts you learned, specifically the Pacheonyeokhyeolsusimjacheomgyeol."

"Pacheon Station Bloodline Heart Master? The ten greatest magicians in the world?"

"Yes, that Pacheon Station, sir. Why is it so long? I can pay you any amount of gold or silver, so please consider it a good deed, as I intend to use it for a good cause..."

Qing speaks cautiously and observes the situation.

Well, even if I heard it, it would make sense.

Kim Heo-jung's small eyes are not so small, but they seem to be wide open in surprise.

The eyelids were droopy and weak, covering the upper part of the eye, and the size of the eyes was limited by the size of the eyes, which is called ptosis in technical terms.

"Hey, hey……!"

Ah, that grinding sound.

Then, Qing slowly descended from Lu Bu, stepped on the ground, and cast a furtive glance at Gongryang Sa-yun.

Gongryang Sa-yoon quietly approaches, grabs the reins, and slowly walks away.

Just looking at it, it was obvious that it wasn't going to be a good thing.

When dealing with troublemakers, it's okay to just slouch on horseback, but to catch a mine, you need to have both feet on the ground to be able to show off your skills.

"You're not seeking vengeance against your family or your clan? With no one to help you, you desperately sought out even a straw, coming all the way to Jangbaek to find the hidden master, Master Shingwi?"

"Please calm down for a moment. Can't we speak in our own language? This old man here is truly a master, isn't he? You're in front of a master of Hyeon-gyeong, so control your anger a bit—"

"This detestable bitch! You deceived me! How could you, how could you deceive me! As expected of the filthy Zhongyuan bloodline! How could it all, all be a lie! I thought it would be nice if you bestowed favors, overcame hardships together, and that affection would blossom so passionately, that we could live together for a hundred years and have five daughters, that's what I thought……!! This is betrayal! Betrayal! Give me back, I want my dream back!"

Goosebumps run down Qing's entire body.

This kid's actions were so absurd that I realized now that his kindness was just a ploy to seduce me by helping me get revenge!

"No, we didn't see each other or make any promises. This is betrayal. And what do you mean, give me back? You beat the drum and janggu all by yourself, and you've done everything. From the beginning, your intention to help was filled with pure, selfish motives."

"Ahh! So, are you saying that ugly guys should just live and die alone? Are you saying that I should just die like that? Are you saying that I should try again after I die?!"

Kim Heo-jung gave a harsh rebuke.

The momentum was unusual, so even if an angry beast were to roar, it wouldn't have been worse than this.

However, the content is a bit...

"If this ugliness doesn't grant me some favor, what kind of woman would desire such an ugly hunchback! I want to find a partner! I want to find a partner!!"

"Oh, um. I see……."

Qing couldn't dare laugh at her screams, tears streaming down her face.

Unfortunately, there is no social policy in the Zhongyuan that would give men a chance to pair up by assigning them three numbers.

Appearance is something you are born with, and it can be adjusted to some extent with effort, but isn't it true that there are clear limits to it?

However, Kim Heo-jung's appearance was not something that could be fixed by dressing up.

Even a roughly rounded lump of clay could be considered more handsome than that. Hmm. Let's not have bad or evil thoughts...

"Well, in the martial arts world, masters are treated with respect, so if you build up your reputation and make a name for yourself now—"

"Shut up! Aren't those bitches just prostitutes who approach men based on their abilities? What's needed isn't an approach, but a natural connection, a natural encounter without any conditions or intentions!"

Hmm. I think I'm starting to get a little annoyed.

"True love is understanding someone with your whole heart, not just your abilities or appearances, and admiring each other, longing to see each other even more, and feeling your heart break when you can't see each other. This is pure love!"

No, if you don't look at someone's appearance or ability, how can you understand what's inside their heart when you don't even know yourself?

It doesn't matter what you're attracted to, whether it's ability, looks, or personality.

When different people meet, it would be nice if there were only good parts, but even if that's not the case, it's about giving up some parts and accepting them. In other words, being considerate of each other and adjusting to each other.

Of course, it may vary from person to person… … .

But, isn't it too difficult and time-consuming to find that kind of true love?

With such content, Qing was choosing her words to tell Tyler not to give up hope.

"You must take responsibility."

"No, what? What responsibility? Why should I take responsibility?"

"You damn Zhongyuan bastards, you Zhongyuan scumbags, you've turned me into this ugly thing! So, as a Zhongyuan person, take responsibility! Come and live with me as my concubine!"

"No, really. Didn't you just say, 'What's wrong with Sun-ae?' because you were just connecting with her heart? What kind of Sun-ae is it to atone for the nation and take responsibility? And what kind of bullshit is that about a concubine?"

"So, a concubine! Then, should I date a stinking, dirty Zhongyuan bitch?"

"No, shit, what the hell is this kid-"

"Ugh! Why! Why aren't you listening to me!"

Kim Heo-jung suddenly falls to his knees with a desperate cry.

And then he would lie down, pound the ground with his fists, and continue screaming.

Rather than being a person who is frustrated because of his hunchback and convex back, he ended up looking more like a turtle or a turtle.

That was the moment.

A huge amount of energy is spreading out, no, it's the opposite.

A tremendous amount of natural energy is rushing towards this place.

The momentum is as strong as a storm, the sound of the rushing air and the rustling of winter branches are so loud that it feels like all the energy of the world is gathering.

Suddenly, Kim Heo-jung's gaze turns to Qing.

A very ugly posture, lying face down on the ground with both arms outstretched and two legs very short compared to the torso.

The neck stretches out strangely and sticks out forward, and the face shoots out a look full of murderous intent.

Soon, the front paw, no, the left hand, came forward as if it was skimming the ground and thumped the ground towards Qing!

"Damn it! Run away!"

The robber shouted and drew his sword to block Qing's path.

Pyrotechnics! Giant thorns, made of ice, surge forth in a chain, rushing forward.

The Tao of the Robber leaves countless afterimages.

The sound of ice breaking apart is loud, and countless blows from the Baekryeon Island shatter the rising iceberg, scattering fragments in all directions.

Soon, a bitter cold sets in.

In an instant, frost forms on the long eyelashes, leaving a pure white afterimage above and below the field of vision.

In the midst of the pain that was so sharp that it felt like the cold air was seeping into his lungs, Qing's consciousness flashed at the urgent voice of the robber.

"We were fooled! Talma, you are a monster of the Talmaji realm!"


CHAPTER 918

Qing felt wronged. She felt very wronged.

No, Talmarani? Why is Talmarani here? A master like that should either reign supreme in a major city, staking his name on it, or he should be a powerful figure next to the Joseon king!

And how can he be a sage who escaped from the realm of demons on his own? Seeing that, he turns around like a crazy person. How can such a person overcome demonic nature?

But what can you do if you feel wronged?

The monster of Talma has already exploded with anger, sadness, or both, on a grand scale, like a giant feast, a super volcano, and a special explosion.

Qing suppressed her inner desire to scream that this was a scam and decided to start by taking care of the most precious person in the group.

"Damn it, Lu Bu, get out! Run away-"

As Qing turned his gaze in a hurry, he saw the back of a black horse running away at full speed like a calf with its tail on fire, and its neighing sound, Heeheeing!!

"-You're being rude. You filthy bastard."

That's what he said, but it was fortunate.

The blue's hind legs hit the ground with a thud!

The eight Qing scattered in all directions, each running with their own unique personality.

The illusionary clone technique of Neungpa Mibo, among them, the illusion that was running briskly back and forth on the ice spikes that rose up in a row on the ground, stepped on Kim Heo-jung's handsome back and jumped over it, and then behind him, transparency fell and the true form of the main body was restored.

Due to the nature of the Nungpa Mibo appearing with his back to the enemy, Qing quickly turns around.

And, ugh. What is that, it's so, ugly… … .

It was Kim Heo-jung lying on the floor like a turtle.

Both arms were placed on the ground below the elbows, and both legs were spread out to the left and right, with the knees planted on the ground, the heels raised, and the toes touching.

When seen from the front, it was a bizarre sight that sent shivers down my spine, a face that didn't look like a human being, its eyes gleaming with anger and a gloomy glare, like a poisoned turtle.

But what if you look at it from behind?

The back of her kneeling with both legs spread out to the left and right with all her might, her butt sagging and saggy, and underneath that, oh, it's ugly.

In that state, Qing's left hand stretches out gracefully, drawing a soft curve.

This seemingly elegant hand gesture, unlike its leisurely appearance, is filled with tremendous energy, and it is the moment when the powerful force of the Buddha's divine skill is unleashed.

Aim for the spot between the two buttocks, roughly an inch below the center.

As a fellow man, it's something I shouldn't do, but aiming for a vital point is a basic principle of fighting, and there's no reason to be considerate of an opponent who's rushing at me with the intention of killing me.

Duuung… … !!

The sound of the Buddhist temple bell rings loudly but never loudly.

The pure power of the Qing transcends distances and reaches its goal-

Suddenly, a thick layer of blue ice forms on Kim Heo-jung's buttocks, forming a natural shield.

Crash! The transparent ice shield shatters, sending shards flying in all directions.

No, what was that, the blood magic technique was an ice technique? Even the Ice White Divine Technique, which is said to be the strongest among ice techniques, can't do something like that. No, is it possible for someone like Hyeon-gyeong to do it?

"Ugh! Knock, knock…!"

Fortunately, it looks like there was some damage.

Of course, the only thing protected by the bet is the bones, so it cannot even offset the shock of the shattered ice shield of the Tathagata God pushing inward and hitting the unspeakable part.

However, if you had to choose between becoming a eunuch and enjoying the pain of being a man, everyone would choose the latter, so it was fortunate for Kim Heo-jung, but truly unfortunate for Qing.

Kim Heo-jung lost his mind due to the humiliation of being hit in a vital spot that he could not tell others about.

"Stop it!!! How dare you! I'll kill you!!!"

With a harsh scream of both pain and anger, Kim Heo-jung suddenly stretches his body towards the sky.

It was a leap so fast that even Qing, who had superhuman kinetic vision, lost sight of the moment.

Qing raises her head urgently.

Suddenly, Kim Heo-jung appeared high in the sky, curled up in a ball, and began to spin violently.

Whack! Kim Heo-jung falls, turning into a giant ice disc with an ominous sound!

For a moment, Qing's gaze turns to Kangtalma.

Again, the eight young men, jumping, flying, and waving, all eight young men spread out in a panicked and desperate manner.

And as the four-legged blue one was the last to break free, BOOM!!! A huge crash that shook the heavens and the earth.

The earth cannot bear it and is overturned with a bang, causing an untimely pillar of earth to rise up.

A chill runs down the spine of the Qing Dynasty, turning its back on the epicenter and materializing. What the heck is that? Even if a real meteorite had fallen, it wouldn't have happened like that.

Can you handle that? No.

Is there any reason why he must be killed? There is none.

After making a decision, Qing immediately kicks the ground.

"Old man, run away…!"

"Get down!"

An urgent voice, and Qing immediately flew away.

A creepy sensation of something whizzing past the back of the blue plane as it flies past the ground.

Qing, who had crashed into the ground as if flung herself onto the bed, let out a small scream. The excruciating pain surged from the cushioning fat in her chest where she had collided with the frozen ground.

But without even a moment to savor the pain.

Crunch! Crunch! Crunch!

Qing raises his head and looks ahead.

It is a scene of a giant ice disk curling up and surrounding itself, continuously cutting through the sturdy northern coniferous forests.

Of course, the screams of the forest as the trees with their branches tangled together, leaning, grabbing, bending, hanging, and falling together.

Qing's mouth is completely blocked.

No, that's, what, even if Talma is half a step ahead of Hyun-kyung, that makes no sense from a human perspective.

For a moment, my breath was taken away.

It was because the robber had roughly lifted the back of Qing's neck.

Then, as he starts to run away, the black, black, and blue cling to his neck and secure his airway.

"Sir, I have legs too! If I run—"

"That's not even a horse! To begin with, that's not even a martial arts skill. It's not even a demon who has mastered the Pacheonyeokhyeolsusimjacheomgyeol!"

Even in this situation, the fact that he could pronounce the nine letters of the Pacheon Station Blood Stroke Heart Attack with one syllable is truly a divine power worthy of Hyeon-gyeong. At Hyeon-gyeong's level, even the speed of his tongue movements seems to be fleeting.

"No, Pacheonyeo-gyeong, sir, then what is that!"

"Witchcraft! It's witchcraft!"

"Huh."

Witchcraft?

What is witchcraft?

It originally refers to a wrong method, a truly vicious or evil method that one cannot bring oneself to do in good conscience.

For example, magic that involves training by eating or killing people, or taking drugs to increase one's abilities beyond one's original level.

However, in martial arts, it is used a little differently.

The sorcery that the martial artist speaks of is something that he uses when he is accused of using cowardly sorcery because he cannot admit it even though he has been subjected to it.

It is an excuse made after being hit, and a petty word used to bury the opponent by branding them as an evil mind or something like that, by resorting to politics when one's skills are not enough.

That's witchcraft!

So, I couldn't help but feel dumbfounded, forgetting the urgent situation in Qingdo.

No, how can you say that a master who has reached the state of Hyeon-gyeong is being beaten without even being able to fight back is witchcraft?

R1o1RUY1V2dWdFByellBWDZwUWJGWmc4cXBXMENOdXVna2wwVkVTZTBlbFRUa3pzNXRhSi96eUdxRm1YV1FyVA

The martial arts master has always shown off his subtle ugliness, but this time he's really too ugly...

"Damn it! That's not it! What the hell kind of ice magic in the world can create and freeze water that didn't exist before?! That guy's not using martial arts, it's sorcery! This is real sorcery!"

"ah."

Come to think of it, Gunyeong always carried a water bag with him and used it to make an ice sword.

Ice Ball is a martial art that emits cold air, not a martial art that creates ice in the air.

But, if it's magic, it makes sense.

There is no need to ask Danryun Jinyin, a sorcery enthusiast and the greatest sorcery authority in the Zhongyuan, whether it can be done with sorcery.

Right now, my constitution is a testament to sorcery. This cunning blood poisoner's body, which takes what is good for the body and rejects what is harmful, is living proof of sorcery.

There are real zombies who are made from reanimated corpses, so the miracle of creating ice out of thin air seems rather trivial compared to that.

That was the moment.

Suddenly, a shadow appears, as if thick clouds are blocking the sun, and the world begins to darken and lose its saturation.

But it wasn't the clouds that obscured the sun.

Something round and huge.

In the eyes of the Qing's human-transcendent vision, the grand rotation of the hunchbacked figure, the thick ice-covered disk blocking the sun, is imprinted in the eyes as a round afterimage, like an eclipse.

"Up! Up! Up!"

"what-"

"That kid's coming again! Watch out!"

And then, a terrible, thunderous crash that tears the earth apart resounds.

Kim Heo-jung's body rapidly approaches Qing's eyes, a giant meteor covered in ice falling.

That was when.

With a shout of "Huh-uh-up," the robber swings the back of the neck of the blue sword he is holding in his hand and throws it far away towards the high sky.

During the flight of Qing, he turns around and looks down.

The sight of a robber throwing away his sword and drawing his sword, pulling it back with all his might, holding it firmly in both hands.

At the same time, the image of the robber's arms stretching into six is revealed.

Two arms forcefully swing the sword backwards vertically, two arms lower the blade to the lower right and raise it upward to the left, and the remaining two arms lower the blade to the lower left and raise it upward to the right, three postures unfolding in one person's body.

And countless afterimages follow that herbivore.

The White Lotus Technique is a single blow that makes each and every one of those afterimages come true, a repetition that truly leads to the White Lotus, a training of obsession.

Hundreds of repeated strikes in three different positions intersect at one point, high above the head, and finally meet a grand encounter with Kim Heo-jung's falling ice meteor.

Kuung!!

A huge pillar of earth rises up, obscuring the view.

A shockwave erupts.

From the air, all the trees in the coniferous forest tilt outward at the same time, centering on the epicenter, and a huge circular ring sweeps outward, expanding and spreading outward.

Before Qing could even admire the magnificent explosion, the urgent voice of the robber rang in his ear.

"Watch out! It bounced off!"

It could be said that the majesty of the city is to deflect falling meteors, but Qing's expression suddenly distorts.

If I had to say something I really wanted to hear, it would have been 'It's okay, I bounced it off', but 'Be careful, I bounced it off'?

It's not that it wasn't there, it's a twisted body that bursts out through a pillar of dirt that hasn't even scattered yet.

An ugly face that appears from above and disappears quickly, repeatedly. There is a streak of blood at the corner of its mouth, perhaps from the impact of the collision, and its eyes, bloodshot and blood-red, appear from above and then disappear again, drawing countless afterimages.

However, the fierce gaze that burns with resentment is always fixed on Qing, and even if it rotates repeatedly, its ferocious murderous intent is so creepy that it gives you goosebumps.

Qing turns over to him.

The sight of Qing crouching down, as if there were some invisible foothold in the air.

The plan is to jump into the air and dodge using Yoo Seong-rak's technique.

That was the moment.

As he turned his body high in the sky where a strong wind was blowing, the blue cotton thread flipped over and stuck to his crown.

It was the moment when Kim Heo-jung encountered the graceful beauty of the world's best beauty, praised by the Jungwon.

Suddenly, Kim Heo-jung's murderous intent, the murderous intent that had been stabbing his heart, subsides.

Kim Heo-jung's head, which rotates three times per second from top to bottom, from top to bottom, hanging from a deformedly long neck, has a blank expression.

The evil mouth gapes open as if it had never been there before, revealing crooked teeth like those of the Japanese.

His eyes are clouded, but even so, even in the midst of the fierce rotation, his gaze is focused on Qing, and he keeps making eye contact.

Qing paused for a moment.

Kim Heo-jung's rotation speed is rapidly decreasing.

Perhaps because of that, the speed at which it shot as if it would destroy anything that stood in its way gradually slowed down, and when it reached Qing's immediate vicinity, it would extend its hand with an indecipherable expression.

As if in response, Qing, who was crouching in the air, powerfully kicked the transparent platform made of the thoughts of the Great Heavenly Demon King and shot it out.

For a moment, Kim Heo-jung's eyes opened wide. And just as the corners of his mouth were about to part-

Fuck!!

It was the moment when the blue long hair of Kim Heo-jung, who had been balding, was embedded in the black hair of the black-stained black horse.


CHAPTER 919


In reaction to hitting Kim Heo-jung, Qing flies up briefly, but then falls back down according to the strict law of gravity.

Well, because the height is high, the knees of the blue stepping on the ground bend elastically and the shock of the fall is distributed to the whole body by squatting.

However, my knee hit the cushion in front of my ribs so hard that I ended up kicking my own chest with my knee.

A scream escapes from the unexpected pain, and tears well up in my eyes, ugh, I might bruise this…

But the pain takes a back seat.

Because the feeling of hitting the monster's head wasn't very good.

Normally, you should feel the hard bone cracking or sinking under the leather, but it feels like you're hitting a hard lump of metal.

It must have been that strange ice shield that had formed in the brief moment of impact.

Qing turns around and stops.

It would be right to just run away since he's an unmanageable opponent, but is that right?

By disturbing the monster stuck in this remote area, I wonder if I have awakened a monster that would have been quietly hiding.

If I run away like this and that monster starts running wild, whether it's going to wreak havoc on Joseon territory to vent its anger or come out to the Zhongyuan to catch me, it's clear that the people who are strict will suffer.

Judging by what he's doing, he'll probably go on a rampage, threatening to kill all the Zhongyuan people, and cause a huge incident.

A solemn determination shines in Qing's eyes.

I'd rather kill you now.

In fact, objectively speaking, what crime or responsibility does Qing have?

Qing was not rude, but rather politely explained the purpose of his visit.

Kim Heo-jung was the one who misunderstood and fantasized about something and then went on a rampage, saying he had been betrayed.

Kim Heo-jung's simple dream, his pretty daughter gives birth to five children, and he spends the rest of his life stopping (enjoying) the fights between the five daughters who are obsessed with their father and the six of them, adding a wife. If I had to give this fantasy a title, it would be something like 'Yukunmong ~ About the troubles my wife and five daughters are having because they are obsessed with me ~'.

It could be said that this is Kim Heo-jung's desire that Qing doesn't know about, and it could also be said that it is a desire that he is fortunate not to know about.

anyway.

Qing carefully organizes her thoughts.

How do I deal with someone who's clearly superior to me? That's what Qing has been doing all along.

If you shake your opponent and make them lose their sense of reason, even the most powerful master will have no choice but to show an opening.

Fortunately, Kim Heo-jung's mental training seemed incredibly shallow compared to his divine stature, so pointing out his astonishing ugliness would be enough.

Or, in the worst case scenario, I'd be crazy about women, so, um, I tried not to use this to protect my dignity as a man.

But life is more important than dignity.

If we really want to be specific, it was after the first year, during the plague ghost era, that he completely abandoned his dignity as a human being, not just as a man.

So, a plan. A plan to destroy the enemy (a plan without form)!

Let's just lightly poke him first, hey you little shit you look like a rotten pancake, even if I stuck a burst watermelon in your head you'd still look better than me, hmm let's go with this.

It was a moment when Qing-i took a deep breath to fill her already swollen chest, which was about to burst, with a loud, booming voice.

Kim Heo-jung's urgent voice cuts off Qing's harsh words.

"Wait! Miss! No, Young Lady! There's a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding! I apologize!"

The poisonous words that had been swollen to the point of being plump shriveled up like fish and were reduced to a single word.

"Huh."

----

Even though it was bitterly cold outside on the Gaema Plateau, the room was filled with warmth without even having to bring a brazier inside.

This is the power of Ondol, the most powerful and efficient heating structure of its time, a scientific architectural style!

Kim Heo-jung, who had turned into a polite man again, left the room to make some tea.

The robber, sitting on the hot, boiling floor like lava, opened his mouth with a serious expression.

"I said let's hear what he had to say, but wouldn't it be better to just leave him alone and walk away? It's best to avoid a crazy person. There's no benefit to dealing with him."

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTOVZHdkg5M0ZzYUhHRTRVTWpJbm9EeFBUejJOaFg0aFVpc2oxRUp0bWN4Rw

"If we leave like this and that guy comes out into the world, how are we going to handle it? They're so obsessed with hatred for the Zhongyuan that it's almost like they're the real deal. What if they go crazy and start hunting Zhongyuan people?"

"Huh. Why should you care about that? Life is a sacrifice to the heavens, and birth and death are all a matter of personal destiny. If some lunatic comes and beats you to death, the dead one is unlucky. There's no reason for you to care. If you die after pulling a gimmick like some goblin accomplice or something, what's the point of our promise?"

The tendons on Qing's forehead flared.

Since when did a unilateral declaration to take away martial arts once a month become 'our promise'?

"It's not like we're negotiating. Just follow along. Take responsibility."

"Ha, that's funny. Is that responsibility, so important, that doesn't matter in our promise? Does responsibility even discriminate between people?"

Another tendon sprouts from Qing's forehead.

If anyone heard, they would think I entrusted them with martial arts.

What kind of promise and sense of responsibility is that when you ask a robber who said he'd come every day to come only once a month?

Since when does responsibility become something like preparing goods to be robbed just because a robber promised to come?

But instead of snapping back, Qing simply kept her flowing lips tightly shut.

Because, the robber is a monster of the present.

Even if you can open it roughly, you can't open it big.

Ximen Qing is a cowardly and vulgar person who is proud, cruel, and cruel in front of the weak, but shrinks infinitely in front of the strong.

Anyway, since Qing kept his mouth shut, it was also an expression of my strong will to come to a conclusion with that hunchbacked monster.

The robber on him is hmm.

"Well, if that's what you mean. I've been thinking about it carefully, and I think if you and I join forces, we might be able to defeat it."

"hmm."

The look in Qing's eyes is truly insolent.

If I were to roughly interpret the look in Qing's eyes, the old man who immediately got close to me and said, "That's a sorcerer, we can't win, let's run away quickly," and then grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and led me forward, is now saying, "Why are you complaining when I come and take care of you?"

The expression "to curse with one's eyes" is an expression used when looking at this kind of gaze.

But the robber is proud.

"Well, at the moment, we have no idea what he's capable of, especially when it comes to sorcery. Therefore, we need to observe his methods more closely, analyze his power and the sorcery he can wield. Only then can we properly confront him."

Sun Tzu's most famous military strategy.

If you know your enemy and know yourself, you will not be in danger even in a hundred battles.

When you're at the level of a martial artist, you know everything about yourself. So, if you know your enemy, you should be able to deal with them roughly.

"But that would require a long period of dealing with him and analyzing him. That's easy to say, but is it something worth attempting? It's incredibly difficult, arduous, and arduous, and could even involve risking one's life. If that's what you truly desire, shouldn't there be a just reward for taking that risk?"

The logical progression is a bit strange.

Although Qing looks at him suspiciously, Kangtalma's expression is very confident.

And, as expected.

"Your Tathagata body is truly in great pain."

"Miss, you're still going to tear out my martial arts skills in this situation? And the Tathagata Goddess isn't even possible. Even if you were to learn it, how would you use it? If the world's greatest beings, plus the 108 Arhats, were to come out and threaten to kill you, would you be able to handle it?"

"Well then, what about the Neungpa Mibo? I've heard rumors of the divine power, but seeing it with my own eyes is unbelievable."

But Qing was adamant.

"I'll figure out how to make it work, whether it's death or food, so how about you just go back now?"

"Oh, you're just saying that out of concern for yourself. It's obvious that this will end up as porridge, not rice. How can I just watch this happen?"

You're not worried about me, you're worried about my martial arts skills.

But on the other hand, Qing's intuition, his sharp sense, whispers.

Well, what should I say, it seems like the robber is really obsessed with martial arts, so I guess he'll just help out when he's in danger?

There's no need to agree to this kind of deal, right?

On the one hand, I wonder why this is happening.

Hyun-kyung is only at the point where she has completed her own enlightenment, so from then on, it is a process of refining the enlightenment she has already achieved to perfection.

So, why would a martial artist in Hyeon-gyeong covet someone else's martial arts?

No matter what I learn, it will never be able to match the White Lotus of the Robber Demon, not even the White Lotus created by someone in the past.

Well, there is no world, but there are many eccentrics.

What is a strange person? It means a strange person, and among them, it means a very, very strange person.

Kangtalma and Kim Heo-jung, there are already two strange guys here.

"Shh. Here he comes."

The skill of the current government, the robber who was blocking the sound with his amazing skills, announces the appearance of the hunchbacked ugly man, or hunchbacked man Kim Heo-jung for short.

And after a while, the thickly papered door opens and Kim Heo-jung appears holding a tray.

Kim Heo-jung, who didn't know whether he knew or not that he had just been plotting his own murder, was just carefully putting the tray down.

And then he bent down towards the blue, and that empty crown of his head, well, it wasn't shiny at all, but rather had a charcoal residue on it, making it look even more miserable.

"I apologize. I unintentionally caused a scandal. The resentment I harbored against the Zhongyuan people in the past was so deep that I unknowingly lost my temper and attacked the innocent guests, revealing my lack of discipline. This was entirely due to my lack of discipline, and it is my fault for which there is no excuse."

Kim Heo-jung's pronunciation was clear and his voice was heavy, so it was a polite apology that was not frivolous at all.

"It's embarrassing, but I feel relieved after venting my frustration, so I apologize again. Also, thank you sincerely for stopping my rampage. As a token of my apology, I'll be happy to help you with whatever you need."

It's even a really well-crafted apology!

Although he presented what wrongdoing he had done and why, he did not use it as an excuse.

And he expressed his intention to reflect on his actions and even offered compensation accordingly.

Thanks to that, Qing felt slightly uncomfortable.

Just now, I was desperately trying to figure out how to deal with this kid.

If I leave it like this, I'll feel a little sorry.

"Hmm."

The uncomfortable groaning of the robber is heard from the side.

He was a robber who had tried to extort a martial arts lesson in exchange for helping Kim Heo-jung deal with him, so it was only natural that he would not be happy with the way things were going.

So, the atmosphere suddenly changed into a sharp reconciliation phase!

However, somehow, something bothers me, um, something about the way his eyes sparkle, I should say, is creepy.

Maybe it's my imagination...?


CHAPTER 920


While Qing's eyes narrow, Kim Heo-jung places the trays, or rather small tables with legs, stacked up in front of the guests one by one.

This picture appears because Joseon originally had a culture of eating at separate tables for children after the age of five.

On the table was a simple teacup and some sunflower-shaped cookies.

And it was Kim Heo-jung who tilted the kettle and poured tea.

"Well, please drink first. What could be more comforting than a cup of warm tea for a cold body?"

So, Qing carefully lifts the teacup and gently places it under the cotton cloth.

At that moment, Kim Heo-jung's eyes flash.

Heh heh, drink, if you drink, you too will become my prisoner… …! Kim Heo-jung thought so, but his facial expressions were not well-managed, so his sinister intentions were showing through his expression.

But even though they saw Kim Heo-jung with an openly sinister expression, no one in the room noticed anything suspicious.

Because extreme ugliness makes every expression suspicious, the face itself is suspicious, sinister, and disgusting, so no expression can be read, no matter what emotion or expression it has.

Without even knowing it, Qing inhales the steaming tea along with the air.

The aroma that bursts out the moment it enters your mouth.

No, this, this kid, this. How is this happening?

Qing opened his mouth in shock.

"Wow, it's delicious?"

"Haha, does that suit your taste? It's pine needle tea. Last summer, I picked only the new shoots one by one and dried them myself. I repeatedly freeze and thaw them to release the condensed aroma. Then, I added a little ginseng and brewed it."

This is a sweet tea made by boiling honey in water with pine needles, um, pine needles, that is, pine needle buds.

There, the unique fragrance of ginseng is neither too much nor too little, creating a subtle and exquisite harmony. What is it, why is it so delicious?

Then Qing picks up the snack.

A rather rustic-looking round cookie, well-fried brown in color with a subtle translucence.

Yakgwa, in the Chinese language it is called Goryeo-gwa.

"Wow, what is this?"

"Haha. It's made by mixing glutinous rice with sesame seeds and frying them. I hope you enjoy it, even though it's a bit of a sloppy job."

"Isn't this your poor craftsmanship? Did you make it yourself?"

"Yes, living alone in the mountains, my hobby is making sweets and dishes like this, so I grew and ground glutinous rice. It's an unmanly pastime, so it's embarrassing to tell you about it. Still, I'm truly happy to be able to treat you like this."

"That's not very manly. Wow, if I were doing business, there'd be a line of four people lining up, stretching three and a half times around the wall."

"Haha, that's too kind of you."

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTNnZqSDF0OEJPZ0VydmhXRzhrMkNDWG83YkM3NWI4cTkwQTBWM0pxV2hvaw

It was a masterpiece that could proudly be placed on top of any of the Goryeo fruits that Qing had eaten.

In fact, Goryeo-gwa is a snack that is difficult to be tasteless, so how could the fried product made by mixing glutinous rice flour with honey be tasteless?

Even so, it felt distinctly delicious. What on earth was the difference? The outside was crispy, but the inside was soft and not hard, but on the other hand, it had a chewy and sticky side.

It's not too sweet, so it doesn't feel overwhelming when it touches your tongue, and yet it has a subtle, "This is dried persimmon, it's dried persimmon!"

Anyway, wow wow. Mmm, it's delicious.

Looking at the well-fed Qing, a wicked smile appeared on Kim Heo-jung's face.

Yes, eat it, now that you have tasted my secret candy, you will not be satisfied with any other candy.

From now on, whenever you eat a snack, you will think of the Korean sweets I made for you with my own hands, and soon you will think of me… … ! Hehehe… … !

What a fearful trick that was!

Meanwhile, Qing's vigilance was greatly reduced.

Looking at it this way, it's a shame that he looks like that, but maybe he wasn't a bad guy?

It was a trick that worked really well for Qing, who was very weak to people who bought him food... ...but.

However, the tea is delicious and the snacks are delicious, but, um, I don't know why he keeps looking at me with that weird expression while I'm eating. What kind of expression is that? What does it mean?

I would say there was no particular special effect.

"This is truly delicious. My goodness, how do you make these sweets? Is this a recipe handed down from generation to generation? Are you the great master of Joseon? I can't breathe while eating these. These are killer sweets. I can't breathe."

The praise from the public continues.

It seems that the robbery horse continues to eat just the right amount of food.

It was a nice way to spend some time with such delicious tea and delicious snacks.

And then, after piling up the snack table and pushing it to the corner, Kim Heo-jung speaks with an indecipherable expression (it was a serious expression).

"I believe you were asking about Pacheonyeokhyeolsusimjacheomgyeol, one of the ten greatest magicians in the world. Is that correct?"

"You seem to be from Joseon, but you seem to know the situation in the Zhongyuan surprisingly well."

At that, Kim Heo-jung's expression changes again.

With droopy eyebrows and trembling eyes, but only the corners of the mouth parted from side to side, even the most ugly man whose expressions were difficult to read was able to easily tell this time.

Kim Heo-jung answered with a bitter smile.

"The person who taught me martial arts was a person from the Zhongyuan. Having served as a sergeant for nearly thirty years, I've heard a lot about the Zhongyuan."

"Ah, Master-"

"Master! That guy...! Ahem, I'm sorry. We weren't close enough to be called master or teacher, so we were just a teacher and student, or worse. He's dead now, so who cares about resenting someone who's gone?"

Well, for something like that, I think the resentment was quite deep.

Clearly, Kim Heo-jung's extreme hatred for the Zhongyuan people must have come from the person who taught him.

Of course, there was no need to ask questions.

Qing cuts off unnecessary interest and returns to the main topic.

"Yes, I was searching for the Pacheon Station Blood Su-sim-ja-cheom-gyeol for personal reasons, and I heard rumors of a strange man from Baekdu Mountain. Is there anyone else staying in Baekdu Mountain besides you, Confucius? The black veins that protrude from the skin are a characteristic of the Blood Demon."

But Kim Heo-jung shakes his head.

"I, Kim Heo-jung, am not a scoundrel who would allow such a wicked being to reside in the sacred land of Jangbaek. Perhaps the rumors about me have been distorted. It would be quicker for you to see the true nature of my martial arts with your own eyes."

Suddenly, with a "Zzung" sound, ice freezes over Kim Heo-jung's skin and covers him.

However, the surface is not smooth, but rather cracked like a rice paddy, so at first glance it looks like the skin of a sea turtle, but isn't it more like black cracks drawn on white ice with the colors reversed?

"ah……"

Qing lets out a pitiful sigh.

It's a shame, really. The villain from Baekdu Mountain! Wasn't the Blood Demon! It's a shame!! If this had been an event in my hometown, it would have been a catastrophe worthy of the host's shouting.

I had a vague idea when the robber was talking about the sorcerer before, but there was no blood demon in Baekdu Mountain.

So what, I came all the way to Baekdu Mountain, got my martial arts skills stolen along the way, and it was all for nothing?

You lost time, money, and even martial arts skills?

No, where is this, where in the world is there such a law, if I have come this far with such difficulty, even if it is not the Blood Demon, there must be at least one of the ten greatest magicians in the world.

Even if it is the Angcheonsal or the Banshinjanggyeopdo… … .

It was when Qing was at a loss and only the corners of her mouth were trembling.

Kim Heo-jung coughed in vain.

"You must have a reason for seeking out the evil magician. From what I've deduced, you clearly have a mortal enemy who can only be defeated by such extreme measures. And yet, you believe that the swift achievement of the magician is your last hope, and that's why you've come all this way."

His reasoning is never right.

Still, it wasn't completely wrong.

It is impossible to reach the state of Hyeon-gyeong by training like this, and there is no hope of reaching it. Even if it were just this Jang Baek-haeng trip, wouldn't he have faced a martial arts thief (Hyeon-gyeong) and a sorcerer of similar level?

So, if you want to immediately increase your power, the easiest way is to collect the ten greatest magicians in the world.

Whether it's the Emperor Mucheon or the Emperor MuQing, he's whining and arguing that he won't give me the next meal. What kind of a person is he whining about? Oh my.

"But, my lady, I'm telling you, magic isn't called magic for nothing. Such evil methods will ultimately harm you, especially when they involve one of the ten greatest magics in the world."

"hmm……."

"So, I, Kim Heo-jung, will help you."

"Huh."

Qing blinked, and then blinked again.

What? Why are you suddenly helping me? Are you saying you'll help me find the magician?

"There's nothing to be concerned about. As the successor to the Black Tortoise Clan, I simply seek to establish justice in this land. I simply cannot stand by and watch a pitiful woman, with no one to turn to for help due to an injustice, even seek out a demon."

Qing tilted his head at him.

Since when has my story been so unfair?

Well, the current situation is unfair, but that damn Seolga, you gave me false information and insulted me.

Samsung-level intelligence is nothing, from now on, neighborhood-level intelligence, the lowest in intelligence rankings, below Gunyeong.

… … No, isn't the area below Gunyeong a bit too much?

Gunyeong is above, Jayeo is below.

By the way, there's something you just said that bothers me.

"Is this the Black Tortoise Gate?"

Why, among the officials of the State Affairs Academy, the Blue Dragon Dancer Chae Seong-ha was the Blue Dragon Dancer, and the Flame Hopi Girl Chang Yo-hong learned the Jujak Dance.

It is said that there are four directions, east, west, south, and north, and that if you collect the blue dragon, red bird, white tiger, and black tortoise, you will create the yellow dragon.

That's what I heard about Hyunmumu.

Come to think of it, wasn't the unique martial arts that utilizes natural energy also the Blue Dragon Dance and Jujak Dance?

Changyohong said that he entered the martial arts school to learn ordinary martial arts because he hated the Hwangryongmugo Nabal and the fire-breathing ones.

He had proudly declared his ambition to enter the palace to build a reputation for collecting all four of the four elements, but, um, unfortunately, he had to give up.

This one seems to be the ultimate champion, but at Chae Seong-ha's level, it seems like he'll need to train for another hundred years to win...

Come to think of it, it's no wonder Hyunmu is strong.

Qing is not stupid, he just doesn't think.

She is a graduate of the Korean Academy of Sciences, so how could she be stupid?

And as a person from the Zhongyuan, I learned that the four gods of the Zhongyuan were not, in fact, equal beings.

Considering the phase, the term 'Sashinsu' was an incorrect term from the beginning.

Because among the four divine beasts, the Black Tortoise is the most powerful being.

So, if we really have to say it, the term 'Sashinsu' is incorrect, and the more accurate term is 'Hyeonmu' and 'Seotkkari'.

To begin with, when called, the Zhujak is Zhujak. When called, the Qingryong is Qingryong, and when called, the Baekho is Baekho.

But what about when you call Hyunmu?

It's none other than the North Pole Jinmu Hyeoncheonsangje Hyeonmu Daeshin!

The god of the North Pole, the god of Jinmu, and the god of martial arts, the Jade Emperor, is the god who rules over the heavens.

Despite this, the Black Tortoise did not receive much attention in Qing's hometown.

Well, it's ugly... ... .

That was the moment.

The robber who had been listening suddenly opened his mouth.

"Are you saying your inaction is not sorcery, but martial arts? Of course, there are martial arts that contain elements of sorcery."

The robber's eyes sparkle.

Why would a martial arts master's eyes shine?

Of course, he's going to shine to commit robbery.

No, that one, I wonder if anyone would say it's a martial arts thief, but since there's a martial arts skill that looks good, they're going to start checking it out right away.

"Sorcery, old master, this is a true martial art. However, unlike the lesser martial arts that merely utilize a small amount of internal energy within one's own danjeon, my martial art draws upon the natural energy of heaven and earth."

"So, what about creating ice out of thin air? Isn't that a magical element?"

"Although invisible, there is a definite energy flowing in nature. The Black Tortoise is the guardian deity who governs the energy. I, too, only used what exists in nature. How could I create something that did not exist in the world?"

Kim Heo-jung was, in other words, a very blunt and rude person to the robbers.

Of course, Qing didn't really care.

Gang-rob-ma-ya, I'm not calling you an elder because I'm afraid of Hyun-kyung, but she's an evil madu who doesn't need to take anything for granted.

"Oh. That's right. So, if I learn that martial art, will I take on the appearance of a black tortoise?"

That was the moment.

Kim Heo-jung's expression suddenly distorts.

But that was only for a moment, as he glanced at Qing and forced a faint smile, perhaps with an expression that seemed to be trying hard to do so-

"That's right. On his back, a diamond-like, indestructible armor sprouts, forming the indestructible form of the Black Tortoise, and his appearance resembles that of the Supreme Emperor of Heaven."

After glancing at Qing again, he continues speaking.

"Although my appearance may seem hunchbacked, my back is not bent. I simply bear the world's most powerful shield. Therefore, even if I have descendants, they will never resemble the Black Tortoise."

Glance at the blue again.

"There will never be such a problem with the successor. Yes."

Shocking! Kim Heo-jung wasn't a hunchback!

The nickname of Mr. Shingwi, Shingwi, was a nickname for wearing turtle ears!

The robber's expression darkens.

"Hmm, no matter how great the skill is, hmm. No matter how great the skill is, it's still like that, hmm."

The sound of a robber muttering inside his mouth.

If anyone listens, they'll know I'm teaching them.

But Kim Heo-jung's words did not end there.

"And, do you know the appearance of the Black Tortoise? Its armor is as majestic as Mount Tai, its head is that of a divine turtle, but surprisingly, its tail is shaped like a giant snake. It has a long, thick snake-like tail."

"hmm?"

"I am the same. I am a giant snake itself."

And then he looks at the blue and reveals his teeth-

Sparkling white teeth that don't match the crooked teeth at all.

Qing thought for a moment what was that just now, and then said, "No, this kid, this is a snake, a snake?"

Well, I'm jealous. I lost what I had, and now I have a snake that I'll never use again.

But what does it mean?

Why are you talking so proudly about me?

No, I'm proud of it, but why are you looking at me like that...?


CHAPTER 921

Qing sighed deeply.

Whether it's magic or not, I want to go home...

Since I failed, I should go back. Why would I get involved with a strange guy?

No, not singular, with those weird guys.

I should take this opportunity to get rid of the robber horse. If he follows me, I'll go straight to the Murim Alliance.

It seems like the strange man's rampage, which I was worried about, has stopped, so I think it's time to wrap things up and get up.

Qing makes up her mind and starts crying.

"I appreciate your words, Confucius. However, my goal is to find the Pacheonyeokhyeolsusimjacheomgyeol. It's not worth it for you, a renown person, to come down from your mountain retreat. Since my search has failed, I will now depart without disturbing your nobleman."

You should be polite when refusing.

Qing straightened her posture and bowed her head.

It would have been nice to say, "I see," and "Then go," but somehow, with a feeling close to foresight, I have a feeling that that won't be the case.

And, as expected.

"Oh, so that's how it was? You believe that revenge is not something you can achieve by borrowing someone else's hand, but rather by achieving it yourself. Indeed, you have the courage to seek out the magician. You are truly a woman of courage."

Because I was Kim Heo-jung, thinking as I pleased.

"Then, how about practicing Black Tortoise? To achieve the revenge you seek, the divine art of accepting the pure nature of the world would be far better than such filthy magic."

No, why is that bastard's revenge certain?

And you just said the side effects were bad, and now you're asking me to learn them. Do you need a hunchback friend?

Qing held back her disbelief.

"Didn't Confucius just say that this is a school of one-man transmission? I already have a teacher and disciples, so I can't join another school. Thank you for your words."

"That's fine, that's fine. In this world, the only master of the Hyeonmu Gate is this Kim Heo-jung, and I am the Hyeonmu Gate itself. As the master of the Hyeonmu Gate, I will make a special exception and allow you to teach me."

This kid either has no tact, or he doesn't want to be tactful, of course he probably has no tact.

Why do these guys always exist?

If I refuse something outright out of respect for my own dignity and am polite, there are people who continue to offer it to me without even realizing that I do not like it.

But if you flatly reject them, they get angry or very upset, and they make you feel bad even though you didn't really want to.

Qing tries to be polite once more.

If you don't understand this time either, you should just say no.

"I'm sorry, but the ability to resemble the Black Tortoise of the martial arts, or rather, the divine art, is extremely difficult for me to handle."

"I'm sorry, my lady. How could I possibly ruin your beauty? You can learn without fear. The Black Tortoise Gate also has a training method that counteracts the Black Tortoise's side effects. So, while progress may be a little slower, it's actually better."

What's better than doing well?

And, didn't you just proudly say it was a side effect?

No, I just said something like "function" and all, and now you're saying it's a side effect? Is it really a side effect?

And then I thought, "Oh, what is this?"

But then why is he like this?

Of course, I'm really curious, but it's a bit, no, quite rude, question to ask out loud.

However, it wasn't just Qing who was present.

"What? Is there such a method? Then why are you like that? Then why don't you learn it in a way that doesn't cause side effects?"

Yes, martial arts master! Well done!

While Qing-i secretly cheers, Kim Heo-jung's wrinkled face becomes even more wrinkled.

"Well, I was fooled. That bastard, no, I mean, the guy who taught me martial arts was already old when he found me, and my talent seems to have been enough to make him impatient. If the guy who said he was going to teach me martial arts had shown up like this in the first place, I wouldn't have followed him. If the guy who said that beauties from all over the world would rush at him was like this, what kind of idiot would have followed him? Me too. "I was fooled, I was fooled!"

Kim Heo-jung's voice gradually becomes filled with anger.

By the way, this kid learned martial arts to seduce women.

If you look at it that way, it seems understandable that he regards his teacher as an enemy of the greatest evil in the world, and that even though he is an enemy, he implicitly shows deep hatred towards him, calling him a bastard and a bastard.

Well, if a monster with this kind of appearance were to try to teach me martial arts, even I would think that some monster bastard was trying to eat people.

"그 개 같은 새끼가 나한테 뭐라고 한 줄 알아?"

Kim Heo-jung's teacher was always on his lips.

When you achieve great success, all side effects will disappear.

Look at me, I look fine.

So, if you want to go out into the world of martial arts and embrace a beautiful woman, you have to work harder, harder, harder, harder. Will you achieve greatness by doing so, or will you live your whole life as a hunchback and die?

And yet, he confessed only before he died.

I'm sorry. I rushed into training because I thought I didn't have much time left, but it ended up having unexpected side effects.

I don't know if it was because of the herbal medicine, because I broke the taboos and mixed various cultivation methods, or because I skipped steps and practiced the Dafa.

But isn't it thanks to that that you became a peerless master so quickly?

So I also wrote down my method.

Go, go find the remaining three members of the Death Sect and fulfill the long-held grudge of the sect.

However, if you cannot achieve the secret wish of the Sashinpa, I will have to find a world-renowned expert who is close to the Sugi and teach you. As a secret gift passed down only to the current sect leader and a sacred relic of the Hyeonmumun, you are now the master of the Hyeonmumun. Ugh, ugh. Why, ugh, you… …

"That damn bastard, there's a level of shamelessness! I've been under your care for twenty years! Twenty years, twenty years! I've been crawling around like a slave, taking care of that old bastard for twenty years!! But what's wrong!!!"

Kim Heo-jung's voice gradually gets louder.

It was a state of anger that was commonly called layered anger, where the more I got angry, the angrier I got and I couldn't control myself.

"사신파 따위 알게 뭐냐! 비원 따위 내가 알게 뭐냐고!! 현무문은 여기서 끝이다!!! 남의 인생 조져놓은 개새끼의 소원을 내가 들어줄까 보냐!!! 이딴 좆같은 무공은 사라져야 해! 사라져야 한다고!!!"

Kim Heo-jung lets out a gasp.

In that sudden outburst of anger, Qing's expression was ambiguous as he listened, and the pattern on the paper on the wall was so interesting today that he couldn't take his eyes off it and just stared at the wall.

But the robber, who seems to have no human heart, would not open his mouth without even noticing.

"Wow, a method with no side effects? Then it must be a world-class martial art. A martial art that harnesses the energy of nature without having to embrace it as one's own."

"Don't say something like that now…!!"

Kim Heo-jung suddenly loses his temper.

In response, Gongryang Sa-yoon steps in to mediate.

"Mr. Kim Heo-jung, could you possibly eat some more yakgwa instead of that? Its exquisite taste lingers on the tip of my tongue, never leaving my mind."

It was not mediation, it was a request.

Does Gongryang Sa-yoon also lack a human heart? Of course, if someone were to ask, he'd probably say it's because he's not human.

Kim Heo-jung, whose own peculiar circumstances were treated like such, suddenly realized, "Oh no! Now is not the time to be angry!"

Hold on, hold on, the fairy and the woodcutter, the fairy and the woodcutter, three children, just three children, Kim Heo-jung kept repeating to himself.

While teaching Hyeonmumu, you naturally assume the posture, hold hands, hug, and even touch belly buttons, and you can even conceive a child. If you don't get the angle, you can use the excuse of training, and since it's a practice for two, you can give it a plausible name like "pair training."

The Fairy and the Woodcutter is a story from Joseon (omitted).

A very useful lesson: if you have two children, you can hold one in your right hand and one in your left hand and leave, but if you have three children, you can't hold them all at once and run away!

Perhaps this is a story from the primitive ancient times when Joseon's greatest invention, the sling, did not exist, but then four children would solve it!

It is a terrifying plan that would make even Zhuge Liang cry. If I had to give it a name, it would be something like the "Yeo-A-Sam-Chul-Ji-Pi-Tactic."

Kim Heo-jung forced a smile and spoke to Qing, trying to suppress his anger and using the proper tone of a young man.

"There's some left in the kitchen to cool, so feel free to take as much as you want. Now, where did I leave off? Since you don't need to worry about side effects, wouldn't it be much better for you to learn the sacred arts in the text instead of the magical arts?"

It's a rather refreshing sound.

But if you really have to learn it, is it really necessary to learn the Black Tortoise? If you can get it through the Good Deed Exchange anyway, you can just learn the Hwangryong Tortoise, which is a combination of the four martial arts.

While Qing was at it, he brought up the exchange window and searched for the name with his mind.

Um, what, it's not coming up?

None of the Hwangryongmu, Qingryongmu, Jujakmu, Hyeonmumu, and Baekhoju are effective.

Qing gently closed her eyes to him.

The Geongon thing that Heemae had learned before, what was it called, couldn't be found in a search and couldn't be learned through the oral method, so maybe these are also incomplete?

Or maybe it doesn't work because it's based on sorcery rather than martial arts...

And more than anything, I don't want to get involved with this kid anymore.

Should I say that it is strangely creepy and unpleasant? Of course, it is a creepy and unpleasant face just by looking at it, but there is something more fundamentally unpleasant about it.

"Thank you for your words, but I haven't even properly understood the martial arts I've already learned, so I'm afraid that learning something new at this time will actually be detrimental to me."

"Poison? Haven't you already witnessed the divine power of the Black Tortoise? How could it be poisonous when it communicates with the universe?"

Qing sighed deeply.

As expected, this type of person just won't understand no matter how hard you try to reject them.

I'm asking if you're really afraid of that, why don't you understand when I say no indirectly...

So what?

"It's unfortunate, but I have responsibilities at the temple and must return. Even if I were to learn something new, it would be difficult to handle the time."

"Well, then I'll accompany you! Apparently, the Zhongyuan sects never refuse guests. Masters fight each other to win their favor, offering all sorts of pleasures and beauties—no, ahem, isn't that the culture? I'll stay and watch your martial arts prowess."

Sometimes, my true feelings come out, but somehow.

But Qing shakes her head.

"The main text is off-limits due to internal regulations, so that's also difficult. Thank you for your consideration, but since I've confirmed there's no evidence of a blood transfusion at Pacheon Station, I'd like to take my leave now."

Kim Heo-jung shuts his mouth tightly.

A moment of tension rising as even the Qing have difficulty reading his facial expression due to the wrong placement of the eyes, nose, and mouth and the bizarre appearance.

"Hey, can I stay a while? Hmm, how about this? You seem to hate the Four Elements, so wouldn't it be quite a satisfying revenge to just let it out into the open? Besides, if you spread it widely, even with its side effects, you'll definitely be treated as an evil demon. What if you spread the martial arts that the one who taught you so dearly as a demonic art throughout the world? I'll be more than happy to help."

Even in the midst of all this, he was a robber who coveted martial arts.

Who would say that he is not a martial arts master? He must have a strong sense of professionalism. In the end, isn't he asking me to teach him the Black Turtle Martial Arts?

"……why."

"hmm?"

"Why on earth……!"

Kim Heo-jung's voice is moist.

A wet voice, aka crying.

"You're saying you hate me because I'm ugly? I know, I know, but is it my fault for looking like this? I was fooled, and I didn't want to end up like this."

Qing was startled.

If this kid explodes, we'll have to go through that ordeal again.

But this time, the robber who covets the Black Tortoise is not on my side, but on their side.

No, that's too much.

So, Qing desperately tries to speak in a gentle voice.

"Confucius? Calm down for a moment. Don't say he's ugly. Let's think positively. That, that's right, he's uniquely born, his eyes, nose, and mouth each have their own convictions. He leaves an impression that no one can forget once they see him, right? It's all in the eye of the beholder. There's no need to blame yourself. Even I think, wow, he's unique! There's no one in the world who resembles him! He's a one-of-a-kind being!"

If Gongryang Sa-yoon had been there, he might have said something like, "The Cheonhwa Sword is worse."

That public servant has left to find medicine and shows no sign of returning.

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTMGU0cVM0RXdtTTV2bGJDNE1Nd2h5M3dGN1pKak1NT3dEb1FyL2pQRm5mcw

But surprisingly, the corners of Kim Heo-jung's mouth twitched slightly. He seemed to be in a better mood!

"Do you really think so, my lady?"

"Of course! It's not the outward appearance that counts, but the inner self. And since we all grow old and scraggly, we're not going to live off our faces, so isn't individuality more important? From what I've seen, Confucius was a good tea brewer, a top-notch pastry chef, and I imagine he'd be a good cook, too. Am I right?"

"Yes. It's not just because it's my cooking. No master chef in Joseon, not even the royal kitchen, could surpass my skills. Having tasted the cooking of a high-ranking official in Hanyang, I can attest to this."

"See? That's all part of charm, isn't it? And how important is the will to live in this world? And, uh, um, yes, Confucius is a master, and a master of the realm of Talma, no, of Hyeon-gyeong. Wow, his skills are impressive."

"To be precise, it's not a state of reality, but rather a state of mind-body transformation, a state of materialization. It's on a different level from the low-level martial arts of the Zhongyuan."

"Now, look. Confucius is a worthy man, and if you look at his good side, he's such a wonderful person. So, you don't need to be obsessed with the mere shell of a physical body. So, you can be proud of yourself. You were born to be loved, so from now on, let's be proud of ourselves. Got it? Okay, promise."

It's hard to read his facial expression, but he's still giggling, so it seems he's completely relaxed.

Qing holds out her little finger in relief.

However, Kim Heo-jung's hands suddenly grabbed Qing's hands with both of his.

And then, following that-

"My lady, I've waited my whole life for a woman like you. Please marry me. I will make you happy for the rest of your life."

ah.


CHAPTER 922

Qing's expression suddenly distorts.

The distortion when seeing something very dirty, I was glad I was wearing cotton.

At the same time, goosebumps like chicken skin spread across my entire body.

No, isn't this just some crazy kid?

Qing barely manages to hold back the curses that are about to burst out of her mouth.

Because Seomun-Qing is a cunning woman who shrinks rapidly in front of someone stronger than her.

Instead, Qing desperately racks his brain to find a way out without provoking his opponent.

What should I say?

Confession is not a challenge, it's a confirmation, right?

It is not a process of confronting someone with courage, but rather a confirmation process that is done after a tacit agreement has been reached based on feelings secretly exchanged in a relationship that was more than just friends but less than a lover.

A marriage proposal should be even more so, so you should regain your cool-headedness for a moment and cool down… …

No, no, this one is really, really 'real'.

A real bastard who can't be answered with words.

Qing-i, ahaha, laughs awkwardly and grabs my hand.

But Kim Heo-jung's hand, which was holding her tightly, would not let go.

"Oh, Confucius? Could you please give me some time to think about it…"

"Young Lady, I am truly sincere. If you give me just one chance, Kim Heo-jung, I will dedicate my entire life to serving you."

"Uh, um. I was so nervous, I suddenly thought, I need to go get some fresh air."

"Huh? Are you talking about now? The wind outside is really cold."

"I have some business to attend to, so…"

"What business do you have here? This isn't your first time here. Oh, surely you've been watching me for a long time? Are there any other parties nearby?"

"No, it's personal…"

"Then, in case it's dangerous, I'll take care of it-"

"No! Th...! Phew, come on, I'm going to the side office. You should just understand the gist of it. Why are you so clueless when it comes to women?"

The robber who was watching raised his voice without realizing it.

Even though he was interested in Hyunmumu, he must have been pretending to be friendly.

Despite that, it seems that even the robber couldn't stand the frustration.

Qingi cheers inwardly.

Martial arts mastery, just great! Great help!

I wanted to yell, "I'm going to pee! Why!" because it was my personality, but I held it in for fear that my child would suddenly react and say, "You're such a shallow woman! You fooled me again!"

"So, Confucius. Where should I go to handle this business…"

"Well, since I live alone, I just deal with it with a chamber pot and throw it away. Hmm, I'll just deal with it somewhere appropriate. Ahem."

"Well then, excuse me for a moment…"

Qing pretends to be shy, gets up, carefully goes outside, and closes the door.

Unlike the boiling interior, the dark Baekdu Mountain foothills are hit with a sharp, cold wind even in early April.

The eternal snow on the peak of Baekdu Mountain in the distance, illuminated by the moonlight, shone gray under the black sky, making for a truly magnificent sight.

If it weren't for times like these, it would be a sight worth gazing at for a long time, but now was not the time to be leisurely enjoying the scenery.

What the hell is going on, I'm finally escaping!

It's been seven years since I started living as a Qingdo woman.

The woman had a secret weapon that no man could stop, so if she were to go to the concubine's house, who would dare to block her?

Qing walked across the yard, deliberately making footsteps sound as she headed outside. "I guess I shouldn't even look in the direction of Baekdu Mountain once I get there. This is really unlucky of me."

That was the moment.

"Oh. Cheonhwageom? Where are you going?"

"omg."

Suddenly, a thin voice rang in Qing's ear.

When I looked back, I saw Gongryang Sa-yoon peeking out the kitchen door and looking at me while holding a basket of medicine.

"Oh, I was just going to go to the side office for a bit……"

"Is that so? Then I'll go with you. I heard that women usually go together."

A woman's ultimate technique doesn't work on another woman.

But then again, there was another way.

"Uh, um, it's a little embarrassing because it's so big."

"It's okay. I'll sing a song for you so that Cheonhwageom won't feel embarrassed. Yalli yalli yalla seong yalari yalla. It's a song from the past Goryeo Dynasty, and it's one of my secret moves."

"Well, I think I'll be uncomfortable……"

"I need it. It's my turn, Cheonhwageom, to sing a song."

Miss, I was going to cut it.

If this is the case, there is nothing we can do.

First, I'll say I'll sing a song, but then I'll run away halfway through.

If the little girl Gongryang wants to report my escape, she'll have to deal with the embarrassing aftermath first, so this might be a way to delay the pursuit of the ugly hunchbacked man, or "Ugguknam" for short.

The reason why he is called a hunchbacked man and not an ugly man is because if you shorten it like that, it gives the impression of a hunchbacked man rather than an ugly man.

"Ha. Let's go together, then."

"Yes. I'm also looking forward to the song of the Thousand Flower Sword."

So, Qing and Gongryang Sa-yoon left the yard and pretended to look for a suitable place, and they walked far and wide without stopping.

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTeFpabEN3MFlreFpZZVE4V2EvM3N3WHFzNUNrMWFiS1M0bGVJeXVTMjlYZQ

If you're going to escape, it's best to get as far away as possible.

"Are you still going? You're quite shy, Cheonhwageom. But even the most skilled swordsman wouldn't be able to eavesdrop on you at this rate."

"Oh, but shall we go a little further?"

"That's enough. Now, take it."

After saying that, Gongryang Sayoon took out the pack he was carrying and handed it to me.

"Huh? What is it?"

"These are the items from the Heavenly Flower Sword that were on Lu Bu's person. I've also included a surprise gift, so please take a look later. As for the Heavenly Flower Sword, you're not planning to leave just like this, are you? I'll take good care of Lu Bu and send him to the Shennyeo Gate."

"oh."

Qing was surprised.

Regardless, Gongryang Sa-yoon remained calm.

"You're about to take care of something important, but Cheonhwageom hasn't brought any paper, cloth, or rope. So you won't be returning. Isn't that right?"

"Oh, that's right."

Qing scratches the back of his head awkwardly.

Then suddenly a thought occurred to me.

"But then, is it okay for you, Miss Gongryang? The same goes for the robber, and if I'm not around, the hunchback might be bothered by Miss Gongryang. No, from what I've seen, it's definitely the case. Want to run away together?"

"I'm fine. I've also prepared my own countermeasures. I'm planning to create a situation where they can't attack me, and I've almost succeeded. So, I'll just let Cheonhwageom worry about you."

Well, that's what they say.

"Oh, then, shall I go?"

"Yes, see you next time."

Gongryang Sa-yoon waves his hand gently.

He flies up with the graceful movements of a weightless walker, like a Qing tak, a moon walker.

So finally, escape!

For people living in this era, the ability to read natural objects and detect directions is very basic and fundamental common sense.

Having lived in Qingdo Jungwon for a long time, I was able to easily find my bearings, so Qing's footsteps as he ran northward were quite brisk.

Well, that can't be helped.

Because it feels so refreshing.

The martial arts thief who had been following me like a leech had been kicked out, and the ugly man who had been trying to stick to me like a new leech was now gone.

I'm a bit worried that maybe that ugly guy is chasing me all the way to the Zhongyuan to find me, but um.

But that won't do, you idiot. Sacrificing your life to protect the peace of the Zhongyuan and marrying a man... Ugh, just thinking about it gives me goosebumps.

And just chase after them, who knows that there is no such thing as a police officer?

At times like these, I really need to take advantage of my child. As soon as I return, Yeom Hui-yeong will have that child, my grandfather, and even the Lord of the Moon will not tolerate a man who is crazy about women like that.

Then, no matter how ugly he is, there's nothing to fear, right?

It was the moment when Qing nodded her head.

-Kaaaah!! Again!!! You're fooling me again!!! Aaaah!!

A scream full of anger echoes from far behind Asra.

How loudly can you hear the screaming from here?

But Qing giggled.

What can I do if I get angry? If I have distanced myself this much, how can I find a way to find even Grandpa Hyunmoo, let alone Hyunmoo?

It was dirty being together, and I hope we never see each other again.

----

Qing ran. He kept running.

Without stopping, until the dark night fades and the white dawn comes.

So, finally, we reached a winding road that stretched out to the left and right through the forest.

Um, right? Left?

Actually, it's not really something to worry about.

Since we've come all the way north from the east of Mount Baekdu, we're probably in Manchuria. To return to the Zhongyuan, we have to head west, so naturally, we'd have to go left.

So, after about half an hour of driving west along the road, a small village comes into view.

Its name is Cheolbae Village!

However, Qing, who did not know Manchurian geography, could not tell where the village was even if he heard its name.

However, I heard that Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province, is a thousand li away along the road to the west, so I thought it would be roughly a thousand li west of Liaoning to the east.

I ordered and ate very expensive food at the only inn in the village, but expensive food does not necessarily mean delicious food.

Objectively speaking, these dishes are not of the highest quality, and considering the ingredients, they could not have been worth this price, so I guess I was really ripped off.

It is an old tradition in the Zhongyuan to exploit outsiders.

But, where is there a store where you can buy and eat it with money?

Because Joseon was in a difficult situation, even the hospitality of a benefactor was limited to rice and soy sauce, so Qing felt grateful that he could at least cook with a ladle.

After filling my stomach with food for the first time in a while, I suddenly felt very tired.

After the battle, I was so nervous and flirty, and then I ran all night without getting a wink of sleep.

Of course, you can't help but be tired.

I guess it would be better to close your eyes for a little while.

Or should I just stay away from Baekdu Mountain for one more day?

With sleepiness creeping into her belly, which had been swollen for a long time, Qing tries to turn her head, which is not working.

If I were Kim Heo-jung, if I were to chase after him from his perspective, I would have headed straight west.

The deduction that I would rush back to the Zhongyuan is a simple one that even the most inexperienced and clumsy man could not possibly be wrong about.

However, if you don't know where I went, it would be a much wiser choice to preemptively occupy the path to the Zhongyuan and wait rather than trying to chase me pointlessly.

Of course, if it were just the ugly guy, he would probably get angry and run off in any direction he wanted just to see what that kid was doing.

But since there's a robber who covets the Black Tortoise, he's someone who makes even the most skilled thieves think twice.

In that case, even if you rush to the Zhongyuan, it might actually be like shaking hands.

What if you rush without resting and end up running into them exhausted?

Well then, it would be better to go around in circles.

At this point, we'll go all the way north, around Liaoning, then head south and take a boat to Shandong.

If I'm going to go back like that, there's no need to rush. It would be safer to sleep during the day and move at night, hide my tracks, and make a big return.

Qing, who had formulated a perfect plan, threw herself into bed.

And then I immediately feel sleepy.

Suddenly, Gongryang Sa-yoon's voice comes to mind.

"These are Cheonhwageom's items. I've also included a surprise gift, so please take a look later."

Well, it's a surprise gift. What could Lady Gongryang possibly have to give me? She always hides snacks somewhere and munches on them alone. Oh?

Snack? A snack? Could it be Goryeo?

Qing suddenly sits up from her bed and plops down in front of the luggage left in the corner.

And then, with a pounding heart, I unpack my backpack and let's see the snacks, my snacks!

and.

"Huh."

An object that had never been seen before, an unfamiliar book.

There is a title written in a thick brushstroke.

Hyunmumu. That is, the Hyunmu dance.

Qing has obtained the secret weapon of the Black Tortoise!

However, Qing's eyebrows tremble as he looks at the emergency kit.

Why is this, why is this here?

Even if it was the martial arts of a monk I hated, there was no way I would let my secret weapon be stolen and just sit still. No, given his personality, I would be even more pissed off and explode with rage, asking why he approached me like this. He would probably chase me to the ends of hell.

And then, once again, Gongryang Sa-yoon's voice brushed past Qing's ears.

"I've also devised my own countermeasures. I plan to create a situation where they can't attack me, and I've almost succeeded."

And now, it's a complete success.

Miss Gongryang, I believed in you… …!

Qing covered her face.


CHAPTER 923


It adds a feeling of fullness to the tired body, and the sleepiness that had been creeping in disappears in an instant.

Because of the sense of crisis that makes my heart sink.

As long as the secret is in my hands, or rather, as long as the secret is not in Chugooknam's mountain cabin, you will have no choice but to find me and find its whereabouts.

By the way, is this emergency really true?

Seeing the dirty sight made me act cute and show off, and I ended up suffering from great troubles in the future. It was an emergency that I never wanted.

Even though it was an emergency that I had to shoulder, it was an even more unfair situation because I couldn't trust him.

Even before he became a novice, Qing was a vicious thief of martial arts. The fact that the thief didn't even know he was being robbed made him even more vicious and heinous, and his methods and crimes were extremely dirty.

If you touch the right secret, you will immediately be registered in some mysterious phenomenon.

Then, you can directly engrave that secret into your brain at any time, so this is true brain engraving education (physical)!

Therefore, it was also possible to distinguish between real and fake emergency supplies.

The moment you touch a real emergency, a corner of your vision will sparkle as if you have a ghostly vision, and the martial arts window will demand your attention, saying, "Look here."

Of course, there were those who argued that the existence of this martial arts window was not some convenient cosmic mystery, but a mysterious divine art called Somusanggong, or Musanggong for short.

It is claimed that it is a very mysterious martial art that allows one to intuitively understand the essence of martial arts, but Qing did not pay much attention to it.

Because there are many other strange things besides that.

So, what about this mysterious ability to understand all the languages in the world and use them just by feeling, and the seemingly universally favored Jeongja script, which I guess is not the result of Hangul?

What is this mysterious growth power that makes you stronger and more sensitive when you learn martial arts, and your inner strength also increases all at once?

Of course, thinking about it doesn't necessarily lead to a conclusion, and rather, it's a bad curiosity that is very harmful to your mental health because it leads to a rather unpleasant conclusion.

So, I don't really want to think about it.

Anyway, that's why, even though I'm holding the secret weapon of the Black Tortoise, whether it's a martial arts spear or a martial arts sword, there's no reaction.

Either this secret is a fake secret, or the martial arts itself is incomplete.

Or, like the excuse that the robber shouted while running away so shamefully, is that Black Tortoise Swordsmanship a type of sorcery, not a martial art, so it cannot be learned?

Now that it's come to this, it would have been less frustrating if I could have learned the Black Tortoise Sword. I have to get chased by that weird guy because of a secret weapon I can't even learn.

This is a total loss of two million won for the jeweler. It's just a loss without exception.

Qing, feeling uneasy, rummages through the secret recipe.

[… …Thus, the lotus flower will become a great sage, and the Great Emperor of the North Pole, Wuxian Heavenly King, will reign supreme throughout the whole world… … Even without the Azure Dragon, we can live, even without the Red Bird, we can live, and even without the White Tiger, we can live. Without the Black Tortoise God and water, all things in the world cannot exist. Black Tortoise Martial Arts is the most excellent martial arts among the Four Gods of Martial Arts, and it is a martial art that surpasses all other studies in the world… … ]

[… … Cultivation requires first becoming familiar with water. Thus, through this method, one must first overcome the fear and pain caused by water. The first step is to drink water through the nose. This eliminates the pain of water entering the nostrils, and ultimately eliminates any fear… … ]

But? The training method is a bit, something strange.

[… … Repeat this process by first drinking lukewarm water, then when you get used to it, drink hot water and then cold water, and then as you progress, you can even boldly drink water made from dried herbs… … and repeat this process with your eyes and ears… … ]

If we drink macho water, isn't it mala-tang? But you're telling me to drink mala-tang through my nose? Even if I gulp it down in one go, I can still drink it without stopping?

Are there eyes? Ears?

[… … Those who are familiar with water are not afraid of going into the water, so to become accustomed to it, at first, they do not panic when they are hit by water regardless of the time and place, and later, they hang on a rock and throw themselves into the water… … Finally, they hang on a water wheel and repeatedly enter and exit the water, and they are so comfortable that they can eat and sleep calmly… … ]

hmm.

[… … In this process, you have already become familiar with the water energy, so now it is time to feel the water energy among the natural energy of the world. You can learn this through the flow of water, so dive into the rough current and feel the flow with your body… … Enter the freezing water and feel the cold effect of the water energy… … Enter the hot water and feel the hot effect of the water energy… … ]

Suddenly, I feel a little sorry for Kim Heo-jung. Of course, this person's personality is strange. If he keeps doing this, everyone will go crazy...

Qing-i quickly closed the book and checked the title again. "What is this? Is it the Black Torture Training Method? Or is it a general guide to water torture?"

That was the moment.

As he was being tortured, memories flashed through Qing's mind.

It was a memory of the Shinto class where they hung up my limbs and forcibly stretched me out, tied me to a steel frame and had my joints broken to inflict endless pain.

A chain of hatred passed down from the previous generation of Shinto warriors to the next generation of Shinto warriors, um, no,

Isn't the training a bit extreme?

Training is difficult and arduous, eagles? Hawks? Anyway, I've heard that birds of prey of that kind break their beaks to get new ones, then pluck out all their talons to get new ones, and then pluck out all their feathers to get new ones (or not).

Also, a lion throws its cub off a cliff (or not), so training is originally difficult and hard, and it all becomes blood and flesh.

Even if you just want to build muscle, you have to lift weights while enduring the pain of tearing your muscles, and even running or climbing stairs to stay healthy is incredibly painful.

Even if it was martial arts, how could it not be painful?

Even if it seems a bit like torture, so what?

Did he make it like that on purpose to make his disciples sick and miserable? It all worked.

It's unmanned because it hurts!

Hmm. Hmm. That's right. That's right.

Anyway, the general theory of water torture was quite interesting.

Ah, there were quite a few impressive parts that made me think, "I should try that too if I catch a villain."

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTMERyZWcxNGlYV25kY3IzK0tPbFBJZmRRbU5hMkd5dkluaG5EcGJGMERSWQ

And it was also useful information to know that the true identity of the Black Tortoise was not the Ice Blade, but a technique that manipulated water itself.

Especially since I knew that my idea that it would be advantageous to fight in my front yard was wrong.

If we were to deal with a water-using monster in Jagwihyeon, where the Yangtze River flows in vast quantities, well, I guess we'd have to deal with it somewhere a bit drier...

"Haaah."

Qing yawns loudly, his jaw hanging open.

As the shock of Gongryang Sojo's betrayal began to subside, fatigue began to creep in again.

So Qing throws herself onto the bed.

In times like these, it is important to take full care of your physical condition.

And since I decided to move at night and sleep during the day, I decided to escape to the Zhongyuan.

This is definitely not a sleepy thought, but a very wise and strategic decision… … .

Soon, a thin snoring sound resonates throughout the room.

----

As we live, even the most gentle person will have moments when they suddenly get angry.

One of these moments might be when you are forced to wake up shortly after falling asleep.

Bang bang bang! Bang bang bang!

A rough knock on the door.

Although the master is a light sleeper, the sound of the door being banged so loudly that it seemed as if it was going to break down would wake even a low-level person from their sleep.

Lying on the bed, Qing's eyebrows twitched with her eyes closed.

"Miss, what is it……"

It felt like I had closed my eyes and then opened them again, and what I saw with my closed eyes was like the inside of my eyelids was burning red, so it seemed like the sun was still high in the sky.

Who the hell wakes people up when the sun is high in the sky?

There might be people sleeping during the day, and they must have put up a sign telling people not to disturb their guests. What the heck is this?

Bang bang bang! Bang bang bang! Bang bang bang!

Somehow the beat is right and it makes me even more angry… … .

Qing covers herself with the blanket all the way to her head.

Well, it was only an hour after Qing fell asleep, so if you wake up half-asleep, your head will be pounding, your mind will be confused, your heart will be sharp, and you will feel like everything in the world is bothersome and you will not want to do anything.

So, yeah, you keep knocking. I'll keep sleeping. When I get tired, I'll go. Even if my arm hurts, it's your loss. If I break down the door, you'll have to ask for it...

Qing is so annoyed that she just holds on and lies down.

But the knocking on the door never ceases, and it even becomes more and more emotional and violent.

Boom bang bang!! Boom bang bang!! Boom bang bang!!! Boom bang bang!!!

"Oh, sir!"

Qing's eyes, which were so fierce that they resembled the blade of an axe, suddenly raised his upper body.

And then, whoosh, and then a roar of mighty rage bursts forth!

"Go!!!!! Hey, you little shits!!! Stop banging on the door!! Get some sleep! Get some sleep!!!"

It was a harsh rebuke that made me see a hallucination of the room shaking for a moment.

Perhaps because of that powerful anger, the knocking on the door stopped.

It was at that moment that Qing lay down again, snorting with excitement.

"Guest? I think you should come out. The Eight Banner warriors have ordered us to empty the guesthouse. You may not know this because you are from the Zhongyuan, but in this land of Manchuria, I dare not disobey the orders of the Eight Banners.

It was Jeomsoi's longing voice.

Originally, the phrase "점소이" was used to please customers with a pitiful voice, but this time it was filled with a truly desperate feeling.

So what?

Qing-i nervously threw off the blanket, roughly brushed away the wrinkles on her clothes, then quickly turned her head and searched for a cotton thread thrown in the corner of the bed.

And then, nervously, he flung open the door, and there was a warrior wearing blue-dyed armor, a double-breasted armor with iron plates lining the cloth, and behind him, half-hidden, was the figure of a jeomsoi, or rather, a jeomro-dae.

Jeomso means the second person (二) of a store (店), and similarly, the owner of a store is called Jeomrodae, the elder (大) of the store (店).

Still, the fact that the fortune teller came in person rather than as a salesperson shows the minimum level of courtesy.

"[Are you awake now? If I disturbed your sleep, I'll overlook your rudeness. This village has been requisitioned by our Palgi, so pack your belongings as quickly as possible and head east. If we do this now, we should be able to reach Boma Village in plenty of time before sunset.]"

Well, what is this? It's neither Korean nor Mongolian.

While Qing tilts his head, the detective hiding behind the soldiers lets out a pitiful voice.

"Uh, sir, the entire village has been mobilized for the chieftain's event, so it seems you'll have to head east to Boma Village. Hopefully, you'll be able to arrive there before sunset, and I'll refund your money. Since it seems you won't be able to eat lunch, I'll prepare some rice balls for you."

"Jeomro-dae, are you being threatened or something? If these guys are robbing or something—"

"No, what are you talking about? Dear Palgi Nari, you are the ones who protect us. However, since this is a tribal event, I truly apologize."

In reality, the one that the Jeomro-dae feared was Qing, who had interrupted their stay, and judging by the position where he was hiding behind the armored man, doesn't that mean that he secretly believes that he will protect them?

Besides, apart from being afraid, he also looks really sorry.

It doesn't seem like something is being done forcibly.

Qing scratched the back of his head.

It's a tribal matter, but it's a bit strange to say anything about it...

"No, what kind of great event is this that they're kicking out all the outsiders? If it's good, let's enjoy it together."

The regretful sound meant that he would follow anyway, so the point guard was visibly relieved.

"Oh, it's not that kind of event, um, I can't tell you. I'm truly sorry. Next time you visit, I'll make sure to treat you specially."

"[Nari, I'm packing my bags and leaving.]"

"[Hmm, but since you are a guest in our land, you will find out what happened later, so tell them not to be too upset.]"

Oh, I see this is the Jurchen language.

Anyway, Qing packs her bags.

Actually, there's nothing to pack. I was just skimming through the water torture method, or rather, the emergency kit, and then I lay down right away, so there's no need to bother packing anything separately.

As I came down the stairs with my backpack on, the first floor was bustling with people of all colors, pushing, sweeping, cleaning, and also laying down and putting up things. It was chaos.

Qing pretends to watch the scene and leans on the stairwell, wasting time.

Because, um, I said I'd give you rice balls... Even if you arrive before dinner, you should bring breakfast, no, lunch, right...

I was just standing there like that, killing time.

"Hmm? You seem to be from the Zhongyuan, correct?"

A man approaches and speaks to her while looking at her.

The clothes made of golden silk look familiar. Hey, isn't this the uniform of the Golden Guard?

"Oh, is it Tae-ga?"

"Well, if a woman with a thousand-year-old hair and a sword is a martial artist, then she is a hundred times the number of martial artists."

The man waves his palm in front of my face.

It was a trend to imitate the Cheonhwa Yang and Cheonhwa Sword, and it was extremely popular as an essential item for female warriors in the Zhongyuan to wear when going out.

As a result, it has become a trend among ordinary women who admire female warriors.

"So, what about the four gates and the name? When did you arrive here, and where were you going?"

It was the Golden Guard who asked about my personal information as if it was natural.

No, but when did you see me like this? You can tell just by looking at me that I haven't aged at all.

But there was nothing particularly special about the attitude of the Zhongyuan officials, so wouldn't they be the ones who would get angry in return if you just pushed them around for no reason?

Besides, what, I have no reason to kneel?

"I'm from the Ximen Office of the Shinnyeomun, and you know that I'm an inspector, right? Should I bring out the inspector's badge?"

The eyes of the golden guard widened at him.

But that was only for a moment, as he stood up straight with a sharp attitude like a knife and shouted.

"Ugh, chung!! Excuse me!"


CHAPTER 924


Qing was taken aback by the loud greetings from each of them.

Because I wasn't trying to act like I had any special power.

He was just saying, "Are you the only one with a government position? I have one too, so don't think about acting like a superior."

In the first place, the inspector general is a government official of the seventh rank.

The rank of Geumuiwi starts from the lowest rank of Jeongchil-pum, the rank of Jojang is Jong-fifth-pum, and the rank of Danjang is Jong-sam-pum.

So, in fact, if we look at the hierarchy, it was an equal or lower situation, so there was no need to treat him like a scary senior.

Judging by your attitude, it doesn't seem like you see me as a princess.

Well, actually, rank is just a number.

True power is determined by whose tightrope one is walking, the power of the one who is walking that tightrope, and whether one is just barely holding on to the very tip of the rope, or whether one is tightly tied to the thick front rope.

Who will draw the line of Seomuncheonhwa?

Since the position of Twelve Inspectors can directly deliver messages to the Emperor, isn't it originally a position given to a loyal subject of the Emperor?

And since the Imperial Guards were also soldiers directly under the Emperor, they had no choice but to accept the new Inspector General Ximen Cheonhwa as their superior.

"No, you don't have to be so nervous-"

R1o1RUY1V2dWdFByellBWDZwUWJGV2poRU1rR2NERXJGVjBQSkxvdTJuQWZXbUk0ZktiRVJ6aEhUekNqcjBzRw

"Hey, what's all this fuss about? If you're going to take the flag, take it somewhere unseen, or do you want to take it here, with your head down? What on earth do you think the Jurchens will think? Anyway, the way those Royal Guards act is truly... utterly undignified."

A hoarse voice is a characteristic of eunuchs.

It's a bit funny to hear eunuchs talk about dignity, but the fact that eunuchs and the Royal Guard are enemies is a long-standing tradition.

"Hmm? Who are you? Hey, Myeon Wisa. If new personnel are joining, shouldn't you announce it? Are you doing the operation alone? Even if it's just between us, we should cooperate where necessary. No, you're the same. If you're here, you shouldn't be holding military discipline first, you should be meeting with the person in charge and discussing it first. What the hell is this, seriously?"

"No, I'm not a member of the Golden Guard-"

"Then what? An outsider? By any chance, Mr. Myeon, have you called your lover? Do you think we're going on an outing to the fields of flowers? Why are you acting like this the moment you enter Manchuria? Well, young lady, state affairs are underway. No matter how careless you may be in the spring or the fourth month of the lunar year, you can't act like this. Go back to the Zhongyuan."

It was a eunuch who shouted in a hoarse voice.

Qing scratched his chin.

"No, I'm Seomun-Qing-"

Then bang!

Before Qing could finish speaking, the eunuch threw himself straight to the floor.

Also known as the five-body prostration, it was an extreme form of greeting in which the arms and legs were stretched out in front of one another and the tips of the toes, knees, stomach, elbows, and backs of the hands were placed on the floor.

"Hello, sir! I'm not a thousand, no, hundred years old, but, uh, uh, uh."

I was about to get up from my knees and raise both my hands, but then I changed my words and fell back down, but then I felt like I had to do something and tried to raise both my arms high again, but I couldn't do this or that because I couldn't live a thousand years and a hundred years was strange.

The eunuch lay there, as if he had some kind of broken body, and then he got up and waved his arms.

Of course it was bound to break.

Princess Mama suddenly popped out!

Well, if you look at her as a princess, this is her reaction… … .

Qing laughs bitterly and wakes up the eunuch.

"Ah, you are so kind to extend a hand to even this thousand-year-old..."

"I stopped by Jangbaek on business and was on my way back. It looks like the inn is closing, so I was just about to leave. I'm not here as an inspector, and I don't know what's happening, so there's no need to be so formal."

"How could a thousand things dare to do so? It is an honor for me to meet you like this…."

A cold sweat dripped down the spine of the watching Royal Guard.

They say that the Ximen Inspector is favored by the Empress, but even that meticulous eunuch is at a loss and doesn't know what to do.

In that case, a mere leader of the Golden Guards, he is a person of immense power who can be extinguished with just a breath of his nose!

The back of the Golden Guard becomes more upright.

The sudden attack of the grandson!

You might run into the grandson while he's traveling.

However, the act of daring to drive the grandson out of his residence, which is so impudent and reckless, will become a very big problem.

Of course, there was no reason or intention to be so sensitive to Qing.

The old eunuch was greatly relieved to hear that Qing had no intention of making a fuss and told him the story of how they had met.

"Ah, peace trip……."

The true identity of the joint event between the Zhongyuan and the Jurchen was Princess Yeonsul's wedding, or more accurately, a peace procession.

Then suddenly something comes to mind.

"Oh, by the way, what about Lord Murong? Wasn't he perhaps mobilized for the peace procession?"

"The Murong clan was sent back long ago. What good would it do to bring Murong into Jurchen territory? The Zhongyuan escort never reached Jurchen territory in the first place, so our troops have already returned after completing their exchanges with the Eight Banners. Shouldn't the responsibility for escorting the Jurchens in Jurchen territory lie entirely with the Jurchens?"

From the land of Manchuria, the Zhongyuan military withdrew and the Jurchen military took over as the escort.

From here on out, it's your land, and what happens on your land isn't our responsibility, so you should take responsibility for the security as well. At first glance, this may seem like a petty motive.

However, this is not an act of passing the buck, but rather a consideration to avoid causing inconvenience to both parties.

In the past, when the Zhongyuan were divided into several parts and in chaos, there were frequent cases of soldiers suddenly launching attacks under the pretext of escorting peace marches and then going deep into the area.

It was a story from a long time ago, in a time when there were no laws or morals, and even the words "to live a good life" required great courage.

Even if that weren't the case, it would be natural for me to feel good if another country's army or experts came all the way to my country's castle.

So, these visits by peace envoys or ambassadors are a change of guard at the border.

So the original escort was sent back, and the only people left were Yeonsul and the two maids.

A eunuch from the Ministry of the Interior personally came forward to receive the royal edict, and two royal guards escorted him.

These six people are the total number of people involved in the peace procession.

"Is it a school?"

"Ah, I plan to confer the title of General of the East on the royal son-in-law."

This would be valuable information that anyone with knowledge would not want to overlook.

Wouldn't giving the position of general to a foreigner from the border region be tantamount to giving him the authority to govern one of the border regions?

Why entrust the border to barbarians?

It would be to take out the soldiers there and use them separately.

It could mean that you're about to invade somewhere, or that someone is about to invade.

But what about the level of Qing's insight?

After hearing this advanced information, this was exactly what Qing thought.

Well, General. The word General sounds really cool, it really has a nice sound.

"I would like to offer you my majesty's hospitality, but as I am a servant of the royal decree, please remember that my heart still belongs to you. Hehe. Then, please rest for a moment, and I will serve you lunch later."

No matter what, the sound of an old man laughing coquettishly in a nasal voice is so unfamiliar that it gives me goosebumps.

Although the eunuch's unique way of speaking was intended for that purpose, it was a way of speaking created to make the palace maids lose interest in him.

After sending the eunuch away, Qing throws himself on the bed again.

Actually, I was just going to leave.

It would be shameless to interfere in government affairs after boldly declaring that you would rather live as Ximen Qing, a martial artist, than as Princess Sohal.

Of course, he always thought like this, but when it was really necessary, he would pull out his secret weapon without hesitation, but Qingdo Joogeum would feel wronged.

Did I bring it up just to eat well and live well, or to satisfy my own selfish desires? I used it all for good things.

Anyway, this time I was really, really going to just leave.

But the old eunuch shed tears, not just words, but real tears, and held onto the hem of the Qing trouser leg.

Please don't make me a traitor who has driven out the royal family, and not just any royal family, but a direct descendant of heaven.

When I heard it, it was true, and it was a persuasive appeal that could not be logically refuted.

It's definitely not because of the banquet table provided by the best Jurchen chef for lunch and dinner, and, gulp, yes, absolutely not.

Just to protect the heart of a eunuch who had lived his entire life proudly, dedicating his life to loyalty.

By the way, what will be for lunch… … .

So we decided to leave at night as originally scheduled.

Of course, if they give you lunch, you eat lunch, and if they give you dinner, you eat dinner. Well, I had originally planned to eat at the guest house, so it's exactly as planned.

Of course, how many times has Qing planned something and it all went as planned?

Until lunchtime, he was still a bit sleepy and tired of staying awake, so he asked for the bath water to be warmed up and he soaked himself in it.

With my body melting away so tiredly, I felt like I would sleep through the banquet and all, so I spread out the Hyeonmumu secret book and dozed off, thinking about the profound world of water torture, or rather, how to become friendly with water, while passing the time.

And the long-awaited banquet!

He said he would bring it up to the room, but the two of them, Jeomro-dae and Jeomso-i, struggled to bring the huge dining table in slowly and carefully.

Something with lots of meat, stewed meat, fish, chicken, duck, pheasant, and vegetables? Do the Jurchens eat vegetables? It tastes so familiar, I like it.

Normally, even if I were eating alone, I would eat with the help of Jeomsoi's cooking explanations, but this time, I was so busy with the peace banquet that I had no choice but to just eat whatever was given to me without knowing anything.

Even though I didn't know it was delicious, I still ate it, so I'll admit that he's the best chef of the Jurchen people, and indeed, he's qualified to represent a nation. Thump thump thump.

Perhaps he had heard about the amount of food Qing ate, and as soon as he finished eating, he flew straight to the bed.

How can I express the satisfaction of lying down with my stomach full and feeling full?

Up to this point, everything was going according to Qing's plan.

Knock knock. There's a knock on the door.

As Qing answered, a stranger in yellow armor nodded lightly and entered the room.

Then, I flinched for a moment when I saw the plates neatly emptied on the large table.

If the Qing had known about the Eight Banners, they could have inferred their rank from the color of the man's armor, which was gold silk trimmed with red cloth.

Because it was the symbol of the Yang Huang Flag, the flag of the great general among the Eight Banners, and the symbol of the chieftain's personal guard and the most elite warriors among the Eight Banners.

But I don't know about Yejin, but Qing just said, "These guys are really colorful. Do they just choose the color of their armor based on their favorite color?"

"My name is Pori, and I am the captain of the escort team."

"Oh, are you Mr. Po?"

"Pori is a given name. If we were to use the surname of the Zhongyuan, it would be Aesin Gakra Pori, but this is a bit different from a surname. You can call yourself Aesin Gakra Pori, but it's rude for others to call you that unless you're a chief or a priest. This is rude to the tribe? Disloyal? Disloyal? I'm not sure if that's the right expression, but you should call me Pori."

"Oh, yes. This is Seomun-Qing. Um, so, what business do you have?"

"I heard that Your Majesty is a very close associate of the Emperor. Is that correct?"

I have already heard that they will convey this to the Jurchen escort.

It was to avoid diplomatic discourtesy.

Even though the actual power of the inspector general is immense, he is still a low-ranking official, so if he interferes in the security situation of another country without permission, the picture will become very strange.

That doesn't mean I'm a princess, either. To be precise, I can't say, "I'm the real princess."

So, he is a close associate of the emperor, a close associate of the emperor, and even if we happened to meet him, we would never be able to treat him coldly, he said, making excuses like this.

When I told him that I would just leave now, the eunuch held onto his trousers and cried.

"Uh, um. It's similar, right?"

"And I also heard you were leaving quietly. You only ran into me while on a tour of Manchuria, right?"

"Yes, I went to Baekdu Mountain."

"Ah, Jangbaeksan! Jangbaeksan is great. Actually, I came here to tell you that you don't have to leave. It's a shame for our escorts to be respectful? It's rude? Um, I appreciate your consideration. Since you're a distinguished guest, we'd like to formally invite you to our wedding."

Something, suddenly the atmosphere was changed when an invitation was sent.


CHAPTER 925

In a way, it was an absurd situation to invite Princess Yeonsul as a guest to Princess Yeonsul's wedding without Princess Yeonsul.

Qing didn't think of herself as a princess of magic, so she wasn't particularly impressed.

However, there was something other than excitement.

"Oh my goodness, how absurd, how could the princess be celebrating the princess's wedding? Oh my goodness, how absurd could this be…!"

What was truly outrageous was the eunuch's woman's sly voice, but Qing had become accustomed to eunuchs and this too was of little interest.

Moreover, after the Qing Emperor's visit to the palace, the real Princess of the Qing Dynasty was retrieved, and the fake Princess of the Qing Dynasty was recognized as the real Princess of the Qing Dynasty, so it cannot be said that it was the wedding ceremony of the fake Princess of the Qing Dynasty.

Now, fake magic is real magic.

You might say that it's too much to send her off to marry a barbarian as soon as you find out she's fake.

However, it is not really like that, as it was a very old tradition in the Zhongyuan for the emperor to adopt a princess and then give her as a gift to a barbarian.

Since the fake princess was known to be the emperor's biological daughter, she should have been treated better. In fact, it could be said that she was in a better position than after being adopted.

"Mama, I know it's a bit outrageous to say this, but if you decline the invitation to the wedding, it could become a sensitive issue. If you keep talking nonsense, you'll end up like, "What a bad mouth, what a bad mouth!"

The eunuch licks my lips.

If you think about it, she could have just been a proper lady of the palace, but she insisted on saying that she was the emperor's closest confidant and ended up receiving an invitation.

It was an excessive loyalty that came from the fear that the true descendants of heaven might be treated with contempt.

"Hey, that's fine. Since it's come to this, I'll just stop by for a bit and then go."

It wasn't a particularly difficult decision.

Actually, it's not a question of whether I want to attend the wedding or not, but rather whether I might cause trouble on a good day because of me.

I'm concerned about the ugly guy and the robber, but even if they're just those two, how could they try to mess with someone else's wedding? Hmm, I guess they could do that. Hmm.

Still, they probably think I'm trying to escape to the Zhongyuan, and they'll never imagine me going deep into Manchuria.

We can eat some delicious food on the way, and then just go around to Heilongjiang and come back.

In comparison, it is said that if you decline a wedding invitation, you will definitely become a nuisance.

Well then, I should go, why… … .

Of course, some might say that he should have just endured his status as an inspector from the beginning, and that he would live proudly as a martial artist named Ximen Qing, but instead, he becomes the Twelve Province Inspector Seomuncheonhwa and enjoys being a superior whenever it suits him.

This time, Qing was innocent.

If it had been another time, I wouldn't have known, but since the Royal Guard had come to check the area and demanded that I reveal my identity first, I would have made a fuss and told them to reveal it immediately even if I tried to hide it.

Of course, the Royal Guard didn't have any ill feelings towards him, but he just thought it was suspicious that a martial artist had suddenly appeared in this faraway land of Manchuria, and on the way to peace, during the princess's ceremonial duties.

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTOFNTNzFacWNzZ2twU2x2RlZra3QxQis0RjVXYWVpWE5IWEpNbnMvdXlqVQ

A situation where it is neither anyone's fault nor anyone's fault.

If we really had to point out a problem, it would be that Qing was staying at a bad time and in a bad place, and the root cause of this was the gangster, the corrupt official Kim Heo-jung, and the strange guy, strange girl, and strange guy trio.

Yes, I was a pure victim… … .

It was when Qing was gnashing his teeth about that strange trio.

"Excuse me, Mama. Is that, by any chance?"

"Hmm? Yes?"

"If you happen to want to meet that person, that person, that person, that is, the bride at the wedding…"

The eunuch chooses his words very carefully and watches Qing's expression.

"Do you want to meet Princess Yeonsul?"

"Yes, I don't mean anything else, but I was wondering if your Majesty had any such thoughts……"

"No. Not really? And why?"

It was an immediate answer.

Perhaps because the sharp reply flew at him as if there was no reason to worry, a feeling of relief flashed across the old eunuch's expression.

Eunuchs are essentially people who hide themselves. If they show signs of relief on the outside, it means they are truly relieved.

No, what? Are you afraid I'll grab your hair and shake you like I'm some fake person?

As I said, why bother?

Qing had no interest in the fake Yeonsul.

Well, if you don't think it's real, why would you be interested in a fake?

However, it seems that the fake Yeonsul is not a villain who wields power and commits evil acts under false pretenses.

According to the testimony of the Cheonnyeo Temple, it was a hastily arranged substitute after the real Yeonsul failed to revive, so it was not something she did to elevate her status.

Well, then, he should just live his life, and I should live mine. Besides, what's the point of meeting up anyway?

'Excuse me, am I 'real'?'

'Oh, is that so? Oh, then... ... .'

'No, it's just something like that... ... .'

'… … … '

'… … … '

Ugh, isn't it awkward just thinking about it?

So, let's just pretend not to know, like a cow looking at a chicken, or a chicken looking at a cow.

In the first place, it was a stand-in that you wouldn't have seen if you didn't specifically ask to see it.

Since it was a journey for a wedding, wouldn't it be a custom in the Zhongyuan to not show one's face to outsiders?

So, well, I thought, maybe we'll run into each other.

From morning, the village wakes up bustling with activity.

The Jurchen's elite warriors, the Eight Banners, once again prepare to escort the peace procession. The sound of roll calls, the smoke billowing from various quarters, and the savory aroma of the guard's meals and the simmering of rations for the cavalry waft through the air.

On one hand, a series of cavalry departed first, marking the departure of an elite cavalry advance party that would advance ahead to announce the arrival of the procession and prepare for safety and the environment in advance.

Of course, this is only the situation of the Jurchen escort.

Qing, who was treated as a VIP, woke up slowly, washed her face with warm water that appeared from somewhere, had a hearty breakfast, and just spent the time roughly.

Only after such a busy morning did the carriage carrying the fake princess begin to slowly roll away.

The sight of the cavalry stretching out in front and behind, reaching a hundred meters in height, is quite a spectacular sight.

However, for some reason, it was given a colorful twist.

The colors of the armor are not unified, so it looks a bit messy.

Four colors: red, yellow, blue, and white.

Three colors: red border yellow, red border blue, and red border white.

And if you put a red border on red, it's just red, so it's a cavalry of eight colors, including red armor with a white border.

Flag bearers, each with a flag matching the color of their armor, formed a wedge shape in front of the bridal carriage.

Eight flags, eight banners.

This is the pride and joy of the Jurchens, the Eight Banners, the nation's strongest cavalry warriors.

"What does your Majesty think?"

"Oh, um. It's nice. There are a variety of colors."

"Every Jurchen man dreams of selling his sword. It's commonplace to argue over which banner to join, and even a small tribe might throw a grand three-day feast if it manages to get one."

This was the explanation of the captain of the escort, Pori.

The eight types of arms compete, train, and fight for merit.

Although the flags of the armies are localized by region and tribe, there are groups within them that follow different flags.

Qing understood immediately. Well, it's something like a club. What color do I root for?

"As far as I know, the Twelve Provincial Inspectors are appointed by the Emperor on a special mission, and are supposed to inspect the entire Zhongyuan and travel freely. Have you ever been to other regions? I've heard that the lakes of the Qinghae Sea are so vast they resemble the ocean."

"Qinghae Lake? It's huge. But the majestic mountain ranges rising high on the horizon make it hard to believe it's the ocean."

"So, you've seen the Jangjoks. Are there any special taboos or such when dealing with them?"

"Actually, mistakes made by tourists are usually laughed off, so even if it were taboo, how serious would it be? But the alcohol there is quite unique…"

The captain of the escort, Pori, keeps talking to me from the side.

What's going on? Are you bored? Or are you just talking to me because you're worried I might be bored? Or maybe you're just naturally sociable.

Of course, not all three.

It was close to the cunning tactics of a bookworm trying to extract information by any means necessary, so he was just quietly looking into whether there might be some world situation that he or his tribe was unaware of.

In other words, it was an act called espionage.

Of course, I chose the wrong opponent.

It was a hope that he might be able to find some clues about the precious situation that was happening on the other side of the Zhongyuan, and thus even more important, but unknown.

All I got was a list of must-try dishes in Qinghae, detailed descriptions of each, and recommendations for famous tourist spots.

Because it was about local foods from Yunnan, another remote region, and detailed explanations about them.

Pori's eyes waver slightly.

What is it? You're supposed to be an inspector general, but instead of inspecting, you travel the world, savoring delicacies and enjoying beautiful scenery?

No. How could that be?

He is said to be a royal inspector who enjoys the emperor's favor, so he would not carelessly leak valuable information even with seemingly frivolous words and actions.

Originally, dream interpretation was up to the dream interpreter.

In fact, Qing had not learned anything about these secret struggles, and he was not a very careful person to begin with.

I just thought you were interested in traveling, so I recommended some delicious food and places to see.

So, if Pori were to dig into this in more detail, he would be able to extract a number of rather substantial results.

Wouldn't it be valuable information for the strategist to infer various things, such as the unusual movements of the West Chief or the conspiracy targeting the proxy Baek clan?

So it was only a matter of time before the world's most treasured and surprising ideas would burst out of Qing's mouth.

The problem was time.

The speed of the procession gradually slows down.

It was a slow procession to begin with, but that was only natural, as it wasn't going to be a race with the bride's carriage, giving the thrill of speed.

Still, the sound of horse hooves that had been ringing out loud, clack clack, clack, gradually becomes more relaxed.

Because, from the front, a strange procession was coming towards us.

It was a long way off, but it was impossible not to notice a huge structure slowly approaching.

No, what is that?

Qing frowns.

Blue's superhuman vision, focused on the distance through narrowed eyes, examines the procession that makes its presence felt strongly from afar, and the structure standing in its center.

A giant golden palanquin.

No, it was too big to be called a palanquin. It was enormous, thick, massive, and magnificent. It was a true throne.

Each corner of the huge square pedestal had a handle, and the number of men holding up each side was as many as twenty.

And on top of the square altar that is slightly smaller than the pedestal, a slightly smaller altar is built, and on top of that, another smaller altar is built, which is the shape called the golden pagoda.

The golden altar was made up of eleven floors, and at the top of it was a man sitting on a chair carved from jade.

Silence lingers in the peace procession.

What was I seeing? It was a sight I couldn't believe.

The Taehwajeon Hall, the center of the Forbidden City and the seat of the Emperor, stands on three altars.

And inside the Taehwajeon, the throne of the emperor was placed on seven altars, and these were the seven-tiered thrones called the Emperor's Stairs.

Thus, the Emperor sits on a ten-tiered altar and looks down on the world.

But he built an eleven-tiered altar and placed a jade chair on top of it.

The intention is so transparent that it is rather suspicious.

What kind of crazy person would create such a horrific golden palanquin that would punish you with a "ten thousand times the punishment for treason" just for existing?


CHAPTER 926

"I, I, how, dare, I, dare, how, this presumptuous, that traitor, that impertinent……"

The eunuch kept spitting out incoherent words, and I was so shocked that I had so much to say that I didn't know what to do.

Just like when I first saw you yesterday, you seem to be the type of person whose language center breaks down when something greatly embarrasses you.

Qing looks at the eleven-story golden pagoda with a serious expression as it approaches.

Something, I have a really bad feeling… … .

To begin with, they openly blocked the path of a peace procession of over a hundred cavalry? They had the ability to handle it—or, more accurately, the confidence to handle it.

I don't know if I can handle it or not, but I think I can, so I showed up like that. That's confidence.

"[Everyone, raise your weapons!]"

Captain Pori of the escorts spewed out harsh words. The cavalrymen drew their weapons in unison, and a heavy, imposing atmosphere immediately rose.

The fighting spirit of well-trained cavalry.

The original purpose of cavalry was to charge, collide with the enemy, and break through by digging in. In other words, they were to jump into the enemy's path, so how could they do this in their right mind?

So the act of the cavalry taking up their weapons was like a ritual that made their heads turn before a charge.

Meanwhile, Poriga looks at the two royal officials on horseback to the left and right and gives a fierce smile.

"I am truly ashamed that I failed to weed out such impure traitors from our land. I will deal with it immediately, so please wait a moment, Your Excellency."

Then, he takes a deep breath and immediately gives the signal to charge with a huge shout.

"[You bastards! Those traitors-]"

That was the moment.

A voice that seemed to penetrate the eardrums and penetrate directly into the brain, piercing through the resonating voice.

-stop.

In that moment, Qing's expression suddenly turned sour.

The martial artist could secretly transmit his voice by putting his voice into his qi. This was the art of Jeon-eum-ip-mil, or Jeon-eum for short.

Of course, the principle was a mystery of the primitive era, similar to the martial arts world, that could never be understood by the Qing's education, and that was also the reason why the Qing's transmission sound was deafening and piercing to the eardrums because the volume could not be controlled.

However, when it comes to Hyeon-gyeong, the martial arts skills of the martial artists evolve to a higher level, and the sound of the sound also evolves to match Hyeon-gyeong's level.

That's right, transmitting your voice through a telescope to everyone within a certain range!

This is one of the final evolutions of Jeon-eum, the amazing art of Yuk-hap-jeon-seong.

-Did Jim give you permission to speak?

"Huh! The Six Combatants!?" "Wow, what a master!"

No, you're reacting to this again.

Qing sighed deeply inwardly at the polite shouts of the eunuchs and the royal guards on either side.

Just as counting to three and repeating a nickname after hearing it, admiring the sound of the Six Combat Battles is a way of praising and showing respect to the master of the current situation.

The sound of the battleship transmits to everyone within a certain range.

But then? Is it really necessary to go to the troublesome and arduous Six-Hap Battle? Just raising your voice can spread the word within a certain range.

There is no need to perform the difficult, tricky, and even embarrassing skill of spreading one's story, occupying space, and transmitting one's voice one by one when all one can do is raise one's voice.

Because Hyun-kyung also has a throat and vocal cords.

But still, why do you insist on using the Six Combatants instead of the comfortable mouth?

This could be interpreted to mean, "I can do such great things because I am a great expert."

That's why, when you hear the sound of a six-way battle, it's one of the old etiquettes of martial arts to respond so that the other person doesn't feel embarrassed!

Of course, it is a survival etiquette that takes priority over repeating nicknames, as the master of Hyeon-gyeong might get angry if you don't surprise him with the Six Combat Battle.

Of course, even the Six Combat Battles had their own unique abilities that could not be matched by the raw materials.

First, the Six-Handed Battle is very cool and indirectly demonstrates my prowess (capable of taking the initiative).

Second, it adds dignity to the sound by allowing you to convey a contrived voice without having to scream.

Third, you can whisper from a distance without revealing your location by hiding the direction from which the voice came.

Fourth, when the room is so noisy that you can't hear what's going on, you can clearly insert the voice into your ear canal.

This time, it was the first, second, and third reasons that were applicable, and as a result, the fighting spirit of the Jurchen Eight Banners cavalry preparing to charge was chilled as if they had been poured with cold water.

R1o1RUY1V2dWdFByellBWDZwUWJGVStnbVhpYkNMYjVSb0Q1anBJQzZSazF1N3NQWisyWHVqUHlxYzRhRm1kVA

Then, a calm yet stern voice penetrated everyone's ears.

"Kneel down, you insolent ones. Your emperor is before you, so why are you kneeling?"

There are groans coming from all over the place.

'Huh.' '[That, that. Crazy guy.]' '[The stone is sleeping.]' '[No, what.]' '[What is it? Did he go crazy while learning martial arts?]'

Well, that can't be helped.

People fear and respect the masters of the realm, but that doesn't mean they will immediately accept the old-fashioned words like "I am the emperor."

Even the emperor?

The term "Emperor" was surprisingly not used very often, because "Emperor" and "Emperor" were actually higher titles than "Son of Heaven," referring to a divine being who was the very essence of heaven.

Of course, there were quite a few officials and officials who spoke of the emperor with loyalty (to show loyalty), but this was a kind of flattery and a way of life.

So everyone's reaction was a serious expression, thinking, "What kind of crazy guy has appeared, and a crazy expert at that."

-You insolent bastards! Do you want to die?

A voice that seemed to be angry at him.

As if he didn't know this kind of reaction would come out.

Of course, even if the master of the current situation said, "I am the emperor. If you don't want to die, then let me die," would he have committed a grave sin by saying, "Oh, I didn't recognize the high and mighty one."

Even if the greatest martial artist of all time, the Great Emperor Mucheon, had been seated in that position, the reaction would have been the same.

Of course, the authority of the emperor did not come from the level of one's martial arts skills.

So, it was a natural reaction followed by anger that seemed to have been prepared in advance.

"Well, this seems like they're laying the groundwork for a mess. But dealing with those guys carrying palanquins on top of the police is tough." Qing sighed deeply and then raised his voice with his exceptional vocalization.

"Uh, um, uh, where was the Emperor going? We were rude in not recognizing him, so we will make way for you."

"T-what are you talking about!" "No, sir, what are you talking about!"

The Golden Guard and the Po-ri shout together.

But Qing only lowered his voice.

"How about we just let it pass without needless bloodshed on this holiday? If any trouble arises, I'll take responsibility. I'm worried that bloodshed during our reconciliation will bring bad luck."

"Ah! Yes, Ma, no, do as your magistrate says, I will guarantee it."

The eunuch took Qing's side with a brighter expression.

Wouldn't that be a truly brilliant idea?

If he had yielded to the one who had claimed to be the emperor, let alone punished him, he could have been accused of a serious crime that would have resulted in the deaths of his own family and at most the heads of his three family members.

However, in a situation where the opponent is leading a large number of subordinates carrying golden palanquins in addition to the current situation, if they clash carelessly, they may suffer some damage, and in the worst case, they cannot guarantee the safety of the princess who is on the way to peace.

But what if the real princess, as a direct descendant of the royal family, had yielded to the imposter?

The real one would have laughed at the fake one and given it a chance, and the justification for not shedding blood to avoid any injustice before reconciliation was also excellent.

So the eunuchs couldn't help but be impressed and take his side. Truly, the true Son of Heaven is extraordinary! He is so merciful, fearing the bloodshed of his subordinates!

Of course, Qing didn't do any such calculations.

I just wanted to avoid the mysterious, crazy, and confident Hyun-kyung, who thought, "I'm just a princess, so what can you say about me?"

I just said things like, "It's a denial or something, are you avoiding it because you're scared of poop? Are you avoiding it because it's dirty?"

"Your Majesty guarantees it? Hmm."

"Are you sure? Maybe later."

"Come on, don't do that. Let's get out of the way quickly."

Anyway, the peace escort is also in a difficult situation.

But instead, you're taking responsibility?

So, Pori pretends not to win, and hides a sigh of relief inside.

"[Whatever, clear the way immediately! Let the Chinese be carried without hesitation! Yang Ram-gi, take care of the Chinese!]"

Hwagyo, literally meaning flower palanquin in Chinese characters, refers to the palanquin or carriage in which the bride rides.

So, warriors wearing yellow and blue armor dismounted from their horses and rushed busily around the Chinese community.

And the rest of the horses start to empty out the road by driving them left and right.

Then, the self-proclaimed emperor was rather embarrassed.

Isn't this wrong? Shouldn't you get out of the way?

-Wh, what are you doing! Didn't I tell you to kneel down?

"How dare I stand in front of the Emperor? I will step aside and kneel, so you may pass through."

-That's not it! I personally came forward to punish you arrogant bastards!

"Are you saying we're being arrogant? Please tell us what you mean and we'll correct it."

-Didn't you block my path?

"So I'm stepping aside."

-That's not it, I told you to kneel!

"Oh, if that's your priority."

Then, Qing fell down on the floor.

Because the knees of the blue are very light, especially in front of a strong person, they have the heaviness of a feather, and under the law of strength and weakness, they are knees that are always ready to hold on to the ground for a master of the realm.

"Ugh. How."

Behind me, the eunuch bit my lips hard, causing blood to flow out, but even with the all-round detection of the Awakening Divine Art, it didn't support such detailed detection.

When Qing fell first, the eunuch, with his teeth sunk into his lips, followed him with a mixture of gratitude and anger.

With a look of doubt, the Golden Guard bows down to the floor, and Po-ri pretends to bow after giving up after a moment of arrogance.

Then, the horsemen also got off their horses and took a resting position next to the horses.

After a while like that.

"Your Majesty? Should I kneel further?"

-… … .

The self-proclaimed emperor is silent.

And then.

"Ha, you prideless bastards, are you so afraid of death? Yeah, you can raise a gentle dog. Leave the princess and get out, and you'll save your precious lives."

The expression on his face suddenly turns sour.

Then he gets up, taps his knees, and mutters in a loud voice that everyone can hear.

"Lady, if your goal is the princess, you could have just said, 'Give her back from the start.' Why are you confusingly telling me to kneel? Some crazy bastard was pretending to be the emperor, so I tried to let him go by roughly matching him, but he really is a crazy bastard. Seriously."

-What, what is it?

"No, is it just Hyun-kyung? Do you think you're cool just by whispering in my ear with a loud voice and a six-way battle? Seeing everyone taking pictures of Hyun-kyung, it's the end of the world, the end of the world. What the heck is this, a calamity? Wherever I go, I run into some weird kid."

-this person……!

In the distance, atop a huge golden pagoda, the face of the self-proclaimed emperor sitting on a throne glows red, clearly visible from afar.

In fact, when you become a master of the current situation, your tolerance for insults tends to deteriorate.

Because once you become a police officer, you won't be insulted, so you're afraid of the articulate police officer and are even careful about what you say behind his back.

You might say that Hyun-kyung's unmanned unit would be so angry and upset with just a few words.

Hyun Kyung is a human too, a human!

The idea that martial arts are a form of mental cultivation is a very old and typical example of nonsense.

Of course, there are a very small number of seekers, including some orthodox Buddhists and orthodox Taoists, who equate self-discipline with cultivation and cultivate their spirit.

However, a warrior is fundamentally someone who cultivates martial arts and his own strength, and uses this well-cultivated strength to carry out his will - this is the essence of a warrior.

How would you summarize this in one line?

They say we are a people who use our fists before our words.

So, in fact, the higher the level of a martial artist, the more sensitive they are to insults.

And here, the unparalleled genius of insult, the master of terror, the master of the invisible evil that destroys the soul, begins to slowly unleash his wicked tongue.


CHAPTER 927

-[Captain Pori, I will provoke and lure the author, so in the meantime, please take care of Mama.]

Suddenly, a voice pierced through Pori's ears.

But more than the content, I was startled by the voice itself.

A sound is originally a soft, penetrating whisper, so this is the first time in my life I've heard a sound this loud.

It's even weirder because it sounds so good.

It was a strange experience, as if the mighty sound of the Holy Spirit was shouting right into my ear, but it was not loud or jarring at all, but rather penetrated naturally.

Because the voice is so beautiful that it penetrates the ear without being jarring.

Then Pori replied.

-[No, this is our duty and responsibility, so we will take charge of it, and you, Madam, please leave the princess in charge.]

While the eight-armed men charge and engage, let the Qing princess escape.

In the land of the Jurchen, how could the sons retreat when faced with the enemy of their tribe who was after the one who would become the mother of the tribe?

-[Captain Pori, even if I were to serve Mama, I would need someone knowledgeable about this land rather than someone unfamiliar with the Jurchen's geography to ensure her safety. Isn't Mama's safety the most important thing right now?]

Suddenly, Pori's mind flashed.

Certainly, the princess's safety was the most important matter, so if anything were to go wrong—

Before I knew it, Pori's face turned pale.

On her way to the wedding, that is, since she had not yet been married, Princess Yeonsul was still a granddaughter. She was not even an adopted daughter, but a direct granddaughter.

And in the land of the Jurchen, with the Jurchen in charge of the guard, an unfortunate disaster occurs when a direct descendant of the imperial family is attacked?

The Zhongyuan will hold the Jurchen responsible, and that responsibility cannot be repaid with tribute or subjugation.

The long period in which the Zhongyuan reigned as the center of the world was, in fact, a product of the emperor's lofty authority.

It was an authority built on the corpses of the enemy.

"Lady, if your goal is the princess, you could have just said, 'Give her back from the start.' Why are you confusingly telling me to kneel? Some crazy bastard was pretending to be the emperor, so I tried to let him go by roughly matching him, but he really is a crazy bastard. Seriously."

Then, as if telling the inspector to listen openly, a monologue that was almost like a shout or a cry burst out from his mouth.

It was quite rough, crude, and vulgar language, but since Pori had heard in advance through the telegram that he would provoke and lure the enemy of Hyeon-gyeong, he had no choice but to grit his teeth and clench his fists.

Soon, the impostor explodes in anger.

-T-this… …! This insolent rascal! Who dares to talk nonsense to him!

"I wasn't talking to you, so don't worry about it. Why are you eavesdropping on someone else's monologue? Oh my, what a piece of luck it must be for such an idiot to come out of nowhere. Who would give birth to a child like that?"

-I will never kill you kindly. I will catch every bastard you know and-

"You're going to kill me right in front of you and then make me some pickled seafood to eat? You should've heard that a couple of times. Isn't there something new?"

-What, what is it?

"Seriously, you're talking the obvious. I'll kill all your family and friends in front of them and make pickled seafood for them. King Wei and his wife have already used this. Ugh, I'm sick of it, I'm sick of it. Isn't there anything new besides this?"

Then Qing looked at the impostor.

"No, if you want to leave even a single line in history, you need to have at least one unique punishment. If you try to use only what's already been done, you'll lose your dignity. Punishment has been the foundation of authority since ancient times."

Ahem. Qing clears his throat and lets out a voice that he hasn't learned in a long time, with a rather majestic tone.

Since the past, punishment has been the basis of authority and an important task in maintaining a country.

In the past, the King of Shang created a method of boiling meat in a pot while still alive to make meat soup and feed it to his family.

The king of the province made him jump on a hot iron plate until his legs melted and he died. This was called the 'envelopment'.

The above weird thing, I mentioned earlier.

The first emperor of Jin took it a step further and enjoyed tying people to iron bars and making iron bar grills, and his prime minister, Shang Yang, devised the first method of annihilating entire clans in the Zhongyuan: the Gujokjihwa.

Empress Dowager Han was criticized for cutting off her limbs and throwing them into a barn, but in fact, this was an extreme punishment called the Nine-Five Punishment, created by Emperor Gaozu of Han.

On the other hand, our King Taejo gave a fitting end to the traitors and traitors of the nation who ran wild as collaborators of the Mongols and oppressed their fellow countrymen. This is called Sosehyung.

They scrape my skin with a steel comb until I stop breathing, and then they scrape even my muscles and bones, and the pain is truly befitting of a traitor, ugh, what is this? Ugh, ugh, that, that, anyway.

Suddenly, the Pacheonmagi in my dantian flared up and the pain struck my lower abdomen. It was a terrible pain, as if I had been punched, kicked, or stabbed with a hot spear.

Qing immediately changes the subject.

"Is that all? The ancient Miao kingdom no longer even has a name, but their punishments, the Five Punishments, remain today and have become part of the history of the Zhongyuan."

These were the terrible punishments that were actually recorded in the history books.

"Except for the Zhou and Jie kings, who killed for fun, all of these are the Shi Kings, the founders of the Han dynasty. Even if they didn't create new punishments and leave their mark, all of them marked the beginning of their new nation with cruel punishments. Such cruelty is a virtue that an emperor should possess. Ugh. Ugh. Ah, this is it again."

This damned Pacheonmagi, this useless thing except for the Cheonma Gunrimbo, I need to figure out how to get rid of it.

But the pain subsided immediately.

"So what I'm saying is, if the distribution of a guy who wants to be emperor is only that much, then he's trying to rule a village? Is that really an emperor? He's a village chief."

-… … .

"So, again. Present a punishment so horrific that just hearing it makes me collapse and shiver. Don't just say you'll kill my entire family."

The impostor keeps his mouth shut.

Because, somehow, it is persuasive…

The reason why Qing's invisible poison is so scary is because his voice is so beautiful that you can't help but listen to it, and his pronunciation is so good that it penetrates deeply.

Originally, a war of words was truly invincible if you just closed your ears, opened your mouth, and said what you wanted to say, but it was a beautiful voice that shattered that defense.

Even though you know it's poison, you insist on listening to it and then vomit blood. Isn't this the art of the end of the century called intangible poison?

-Ha, you have a pierced mouth.

The impostor then shuts his mouth tightly.

They are wasting time pretending not to know while they are devising a horrific and cruel punishment.

His lips tremble slightly.

It is a characteristic of the person who sends the message.

Yes, after a while.

"Sometimes, life is more cruel than death. I will strip you naked and chain you to the busiest street, to be treated as a tool, not a human being."

"Oh, that was already there. Lee Il-hyung."

-Then, instead of tying it up, close the dantian, cut off the limb meridians, and then carve the letters on the body.

"Isn't carving letters ink?"

-It's different from Silent Form! It's different from Silent Form! I said I would close the dantian and cut the limbs' meridians!

"That's just what the Zhongyuan sect does. So, if someone who was expelled commits a crime and is sentenced to imprisonment, isn't it the same thing?"

-But, it is different to announce by imperial decree that you can do as you please for four years.

"Even if it weren't for that, if you're silenced, that's what it'll end up like. And if you erase the words, that's the end of it."

In this primitive ancient Zhongyuan, criminals were not treated as human beings, so even if they were beaten to death, they were considered innocent and no punishment was given.

So, it would be natural for those who have been subjected to tattoos to simply burn them off with a hot iron or cut off the skin, and then move on to a faraway place to start a new life.

This is a punishment that was originally intended to be carried out with him in mind, meaning that he should know how to write or cut out the words and leave.

-… … I will attach those who will watch over you.

"Well, then. My grade is three out of ten."

-No, why!

"That's right. Isn't that too lax? Carrying out punishments that way is likely to lead to trouble later. They could bribe the guards to get away, or even if they don't, they could escape if someone they know steps in to rescue them."

- Jim's subordinates never betray you! And, those who would help you are all already in the same state. How can you possibly help you?

"Then what about the people who will help me? After those who will help me are freed with the help of those who will help them, then they can release me."

-Then I'll make them do the same!

"Then what about the people who will help those who will help me? And then what about the people who will help those who will help me? Are you going to turn everyone in the world into cripples and carve words into them?"

-Yeah, in that case, instead of doing the same to those who could help you, we should just kill them and cut off the root of the trouble.

"Well, then what about this point?"

-Don't be stubborn! Why is your score going down even more?

"No, that's right. You have to have hope to live to want to live, and only then will the situation be miserable and painful. When everyone you know is dead, is there anything more painful about life? You just have to lie there with dead eyes and that's it. Those who despair have nothing to fear or feel pain."

-Ugh, that's... ... !

This was the power of the invisible poison.

Even if I become a laughing stock, I bring the other person down to the same level.

However, Qing is a funny girl from the beginning, so there is no harm in being the butt of the joke, but what about the other person?

This was proven by the expressions on the faces of those who were forced to listen to this ridiculous and stupid argument without being able to express anything.

What the hell is this crazy conversation!

This isn't a conversation from this world! This is a conversation from the other world!

The Jurchen's bannermen, the palanquin bearers carrying the golden pagoda palanquin, and all of them, regardless of whether they were enemies or allies, all had the same subtle expression.

R1o1RUY1V2dWdFByellBWDZwUWJGYStvcDV4b3ZGeGxTU0xjT0t4ZzUzYTdpRXhiTVlpRVVTSElDUkhqQndWRw

And this was the back of the story where this fight that wasn't even going to happen was going on.

"Mama, this is Yang No-jae. Please listen quietly. I'm embarrassed to speak, but there are enemies outside and you must take refuge in silence. Please forgive me for daring to intrude on your Chinese community in order to serve you. It may be disrespectful, but you must refrain from asking questions. Then, I will listen."

Nojae is a word that eunuchs use to refer to themselves at official events.

That is, the two eunuchs were secretly sending messages to the princess from outside the carriage.

While the self-proclaimed emperor's gaze was fixed on Qing and his thoughts were focused on the cruel punishment, the eunuch had quietly approached the princess's carriage.

The cavalry of the Jurchen Eight Banners, which had been moving stealthily, obscured the sight of the carriage door opening, and then a eunuch carrying a thick bundle of blankets quietly slipped out of the carriage.

Then he disappears behind her and carefully hugs Pori, who has been waiting.

-Please take good care of Mom.

-She is the one we will serve as our mother. We will serve her with the same respect.

The two eunuchs turn their heads and meet the eyes of the Royal Guard.

Since he was a secret agent who did not know the true identity of the Qing, he naturally joined the party when told that he had to serve the princess.

Of course, the two eunuchs cannot do that.

Even thinking back, it was a shocking, suffocating, and absolutely absurd situation.

The real princess risks herself to act as bait to save the fake princess? It wouldn't matter if the fake disguised herself to save the real, but the opposite? What the hell.

So what should the two eunuchs do?

Since the true grandson of heaven has a firm will, I have no choice but to stay and help him until the end.

So the escape group carrying the magician quietly leaves and disappears into the bushes.

Even if the impostor had not been sitting on the high golden pagoda, he could have wrapped his horse's hooves in cloth to muffle the sound and then run behind them.

No matter how distracted I was, I wouldn't miss the horse running in the opposite direction, so I had no choice but to head off the road and into the forest.

Still, things weren't bad.

Because the fake princess only needs to buy a short amount of time to ensure her safety.

Then, everyone who is left will rush to help Mama escape, so it won't be difficult for Mama, who is a master, to escape alone...

However, such relief was short-lived.

'Keeeeeek!!' 'Keeyoot!' 'Food!' 'Rice!' 'I'm hungry!' 'Heart!' 'Keeeeeek!!' 'Fresh heart!' 'Kwaaak!'

A strange, throat-scratching cry.

And cries filled with innocent murderous intent.

And even the sound of the slingshot hitting the target.

The eunuch's expression suddenly distorted.

Ambush, there was an ambush!


CHAPTER 928

A not-so-productive argument between the wrong people in the wrong place, 'On How to Bring the Most Misery and Painful End' was overwhelmingly in the Qing's favor from the start, as they were keeping score.

It's hard to come up with a brilliant idea, but it's really easy to crush someone else's idea.

Even though it is difficult to make, it is a malicious practice that does not require much thought to find flaws in something that has been made and forcibly cut it down.

"Well, three points again? A human life isn't a precious metal, and I'll probably die before then."

"Oh, four points. This one was a bit novel, but, um, it's plagiarism, so it's invalid. It's just a case of replacing the iron plate with a steel pillar."

"No, are you kidding me? You're going to make me a villainess who will never be remembered in history? After I die, it's over. What do I care about history? I'm slowly losing my original intentions."

"I'll give it one point. It's too boring and pedantic. It's just so incredibly painful, both physically and mentally. Is this difficult? You need to focus on the essentials."

The corners of the self-proclaimed emperor's eyes tremble.

The redness is already evident not only on the earlobes but also on the face, so even if the warm-up is done, it is a bit excessive.

Oh, that's annoying! It's so annoying that I want to kill him!

It would be easy for anyone from the Qing Dynasty to empathize with the attitude of a superior or client who keeps rejecting a project by nitpicking over trivial matters.

Isn't this font too big? How much did it cost to develop this? Do you think money comes from digging? Don't laugh at this and do research, because this kind of thing appeals to young people. Do you think this kind of thing would work? Are you kidding me? Do you think planning is a joke?

When people are continuously exposed to such forced criticism, they are creatures who unconsciously develop very clear words in their hearts.

Well then, you try it!

However, while it was something a subordinate could not say, keeping it to himself, the self-proclaimed emperor could.

-Hey, profit! You're always repeating every word the adults say, so tell me, you little punk! About that creatively horrific execution!

Then, Qing declared with great confidence, sticking out his already protruding chest even further.

"No, why me?"

-Didn't you keep nagging and nitpicking?

"No, so why me? It's you, the one aiming for the Emperor, who needs a dignified punishment, not me."

-This, this profit… …! You b*tch, you b*tch, how great must you be, that you must have such a terrifying plan that you'll be shocked as soon as you hear it!

"No, really. Thinking that way won't lead to progress. What qualifications are needed to express appreciation? Does the listener have to be better at writing poetry than the poet to express appreciation?"

-What, that, that, that, that, that, that is sophistry!

The speechless impostor shouted.

Well, it was an invincible logic that would not yield a clear solution even in the Qing's homeland, that is, for hundreds of years to come.

At that, the corners of Qing's mouth turn into an unpleasant angle.

Okay, I'm hooked. Since the plan was already this far, why on earth wouldn't such a brilliant mind be used on a regular basis?

Okay, I'll just stall for a bit more time on the "why me" thread, then bring up some of the torture I picked up back home—what kind of bull was that? That should buy me at least a little more time, and then I can back off and run away.

The moment Qing thinks like that-

… … I'm hungry… … Kieek… … Heart… … Kkiyaaaaak… … Hurts… …

The distant screams of monsters pierce your ears, and the sound of blades clashing against each other in the background harmonize with them.

The sound of fighting, and the sound of a fierce battle at that.

Qing's face hardens in an instant.

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTMFl0b2RpaS9hbkZNZUNoVDd5M3IzR1JkMXJXOHlDYUk4NGQ3ZFRuY1FKbg

The princess and her party that escaped have been caught!

Moreover, the beast-like roars of the enemies, the hungry words that coveted his heart, and Qing's expression rotted away.

You were a blood sect kid, no, I was stupid, where else would you find a kid who would cause such a mess like this, I'm an idiot for not noticing sooner, idiot.

That was the moment.

"This, this damn bitch, how dare she mock my throne! Kill her! Kill her without exception!"

Finally, the impostor's voice bursts out.

As soon as he heard the noise of battle, he realized that the princess was being evacuated.

Then he immediately gets up and kicks the golden throne away.

"Where are you going! You can't go!"

Qing screamed, flipped her palm over, and pulled. The upturned long arm, pulled to her waist, moved smoothly, then spun around halfway, forming a firm hand gesture.

A giant Buddha's palm striking the air.

Brahma refers to the sound of enlightenment that fills the entire sky, and the bell sounds of living beings who most resemble it cover the world.

Woofwoofwoofwoof… …!

The sound of the temple bell continues without a break. The Buddha's hand reaches out, transcending the air like this melody.

A massive career leaps past the enemy, slamming into his body. The impostor, struck in the middle of a powerful flight, loses speed and plummets at a right angle.

Thud! Rather than a human body falling, a heavy, earth-shattering sound, like a large boulder crashing down, is felt through the soles of my feet.

Was the impostor really that heavy?

No. It was simply that the impostor's cartmen had let go of the huge golden pagoda at once, and the loud noise it made when it hit the ground echoed just in time.

"The Demon King has commanded! Kill him!"

The thugs charge forward, wielding their weapons.

At that, annihilate the enemy! With the shout of the Jurchen horse, the Jurchen Eight Banners also struck their reins and let out a strange shout of "Kiyo-o ...

Horses swooping past the blue on both sides, their shouts, screams erupting from the battle lines as they collide with the enemy, and the Jurchen horses of the commanders roaring wildly.

Meanwhile, Qing's gaze, standing alone, quietly gazes somewhere on the chaotic battlefield.

Well, that can't be helped.

You can fight the Blood Cult's demons with the Yeojin Palgi, or you can jump into the forest and help the princess's guards break through.

However, a more important role remains.

Because we must isolate the enemy's strongest, most lethal force from this fight.

Qing's gaze is fixed on one point.

Between the arms and blood sects that repeatedly block his vision and pass by, the figure of the impostor, standing upright and glaring at Qing, appears and disappears repeatedly.

Why on earth is he doing that? He's not chasing the princess into the forest, nor is he charging forward in a fit of rage.

That was when.

Suddenly, the back of my neck feels cold and the hairs stand on end, and both of my knees feel numb from the inside, and I feel like I'm about to collapse with all my strength.

Qing swallows his saliva.

Miss, even if you're angry, you shouldn't be that angry.

He held the weight firmly, and somehow, one corner of his mouth was raised crookedly, but his eyes seemed to be blooming with a fresh blue color.

Anger is not the same anger.

There is nothing to fear from an opponent who has lost his reason and is consumed by anger after exploding.

But such cold anger is foul play.

No, why, after getting hit by the Tathagata God and falling, why did his head suddenly cool down? If he had been hit by a lower being, his eyes would have rolled back and he would have rushed straight at him.

-Oh, right. So you were the Ximen Office.

In the current martial arts world, the Tathagata Shinjang was more famous for the martial arts representing the Cheonhwa Sword, that is, the name of the Cheonhwa Sword, than for the new techniques of the Shaolin Temple.

Well, it was only a few years ago that Qing returned the Tathagata Shinjang, so Cheonhwageom would be the only master in the current martial arts world who uses the Tathagata Shinjang.

Even if that weren't the case, if it were a woman who spreads the martial arts of Shaolin Temple, the sect of Geumnyeo, it would be impossible to imagine anything other than the Thousand Flower Sword.

-Do you remember the name Yuryang?

The Six-Handed Battle Spirit whispers right in your ear.

It was not a voice that was forcibly arrogant and grandiose, appealing to the emperor, but a whisper filled with a tinge of rage.

It's so creepy that my legs almost give out.

Qing's head spins quickly.

Flow? Who's Flow? Hmm, I don't know. But seeing that Blood Cult bastard so pissed off, I think he's one of those inhuman beasts I killed.

Among the proverbs of the Qing Dynasty, there was one that was the most wrong and completely nonsensical: 'The one who hits cannot stretch his legs, but the one who was hit sleeps with his legs stretched out.'

Because the one who was hit feels wronged and lives with it in his heart for the rest of his life, but the one who hit forgets it quickly after a brief moment of amusement and lives well.

Even, Qing is upright.

If he's an acquaintance of a Blood Cultist, then he's a Blood Cultist, and so he deserves to die anyway. I don't know if he's a bastard or a bitch, but it doesn't seem like it's my fault.

No, rather, he was a good murderer and a villain.

But? You already have a grudge against me?

Well then, I guess I'll have to scratch some more.

"Well, even if you ask like that, will you be able to hear me if I answer?"

-He asked if I remembered the amount.

"Ah. I see you can hear me."

Qing chuckles at him, a mischievous smile appearing on her face.

"By any chance, do you remember how many dumplings you've eaten so far?"

-… … ?

"Oh, you don't understand. So, what I'm saying about the dumplings is that since I've killed so many villains, killing them was as natural as eating. Why bother remembering who I killed?"

"Then, from now on, you must remember this. Yuryang is Jim's daughter, and I will inflict the same pain on you as my daughter. I will blanch you in boiling water and dry you too."

Ah, I remembered. Now that you mentioned it, I get it.

What kind of princess is this? Princess of the Sub-Sim? What kind of crazy nicknames do you use in the blood cult den in Hangzhou?

Well then, that was Shiksimma, Shiksimma.

"Oh, I remembered. Her name was Yuryang. But why are you asking me about that? No matter how she died, it was a natural death. If she died from a fatal act, that's a funeral. If anyone heard, they'd think we killed a living person. Isn't it your fault for not raising your daughter properly?"

Qing giggled. This is definitely going to explode, he thought. But?

-I'm sorry, but my daughter is alive and well.

He was impressed by Qing.

Alive? That? Even in good shape?

How? What kind of Chinese medicine and pharmacy are the best in the world? Hmm, or is it that, in a world where cosmic mystical energy exists, traditional Korean medicine, which relies on energy, is truly invincible?

"Yes, I've decided. I'll boil you, treat you, and leave you stranded for the rest of your life, unable to live or die. This will be truly heartbreaking news for you. I hope you'll always remember the pain Ryanga felt."

"Miss, I should've just boiled it instead of blanching it. Thanks to you, I learned something. Next time you see me, whether it's yulryang or whatever, please tell me I really did. I did, and that night, yulryang soup is for dinner!"

-You, you b*tch… …!

"Well then, that's it for me. Goodbye!"

At the same time, the new Qing form splits into eight.

The illusionary clone technique of the Neungpa Mibo, in which translucent illusions of different colors fly, jump, and spread out in different ways, and among them, the illusion that jumped over a horse regained its original color-

"Pasha!"

With a playful shout, he kicks the head of the Blood Cultist who was about to swing his sword at the fallen Eight-Armed Warrior.

The moment when the instep crushes the bridge of the nose, the center of the face seems to cave in, and the blood cultist flies away, scattering blood and teeth fragments.

-Go! Everyone, catch that bitch! Bring her back alive! As long as she's not dead!

The angry sound of the Six Combat Battles shakes the eardrums.

The blood cultists suddenly turn their heads towards him, their gazes glaring with bloodshot eyes quite menacing.

Isn't this the wrong time to be looking at me?

The cultists who turn a blind eye to him inflict harsh punishment. This is why soldiers must choose good commanders.

"Catch me!"

A cry filled with a certain charm, Qing shouts as she runs to the rear.

It was a judgment of the head that only got better in times like this.

In the forest on the left, there is the princess and her guards, in front is the iron weapon, if you want to escape with anger, follow the road to the rear, or the forest on the right. If you want to deal with a high-ranking person, the forest is advantageous, but the rear where the road is open can quickly withdraw the Blood Cult's forces, and when the Shikshimma is caught, then enter the forest.

Suddenly, beep!! The sound that Qing hates the most, the sound of a pursuit horn, rings out.

At the same time, in the forest on both sides, screams and the sound of the bushes shaking violently could be heard, and countless beings were rapidly approaching.

Monsters like blood demons or blood demons, how many of them did you bring out?

However, as if conscious of the presence of the guards, the screams of the Blood Cult monsters that approached began from quite a distance away.

And Qing's feet are really fast.

Jin-gak, who was stepping on the pitch-black ashes scattered like corn, started the Cheonma Gunrimbo, which reached its maximum speed in three steps, and Qing ran away immediately.

The cries of Shiksimma, panicked by the unexpected power escape, follow Qing.

"You bastard!!! Stand right there!!"

"Don't give me orders!"

Qing doesn't give up and runs away, answering.

Shikshimma gritted his teeth and followed him. Knock! Knock! Knock! He started to run, trampling on them with each step, filling them with his ignorant internal energy.

But what about that speed?

Thump, thump, thump! Thump! Thump!! Thump!!

Qing glances back at the sound of the ground rapidly approaching.

A muscular giant rushing towards him, almost like a shell, a true muscle tank!

A furrow forms between Qing's eyebrows.

No, seriously, this is too much. Seriously, with such an ignorant method... No, Master, if you only consider lightness, you wouldn't lose to Hyun-kyung.

That's because Shikshimma didn't use lightness.

Just kicking the ground with ignorant force in my feet. Every time I kick, a hole half a meter in radius is dug into the ground, and a pillar of dirt shoots up.

It was a very crude charge that could never be called light, as the body of the Siksimma was thrown back by the recoil.

"No, let's fight fair and square! What's the shame of that when you're as good as Hyun-kyung!"

"Shut up!"

"Don't give me orders, Nikkiyak!?"

Suddenly, a bang! Something huge rushes in!

Qing flies to him in a hurry.


CHAPTER 929

With both arms outstretched and parallel, the blue body flies low above the ground.

For a very brief moment, at a very furious pace.

Of course, gravity exists even in the present-day pseudo-ancient Zhongyuan, so the Qing's elongated body gradually draws a parabola.

Then, like someone jumping into water, Qing clasps his arms together and plummets. The moment his palms touch the ground, his elbows flexibly fold, dissipating the force, and in an instant, the back of his head quietly touches the ground.

The world turned around.

The contact surface of the fruit and the ground runs from the back of the head, through the back of the neck, to the back of the spine, and as soon as the gently curved spine rolls past the plump buttocks, the soles of the feet touch the ground again and the body springs up.

It was a breathtaking forward roll that felt more elegant than violent, despite jumping a full four chapters.

Qing, who suddenly got up, started running briskly again by performing the Thousand Horse Racing Sambo acceleration.

But Qing's mind was complicated.

Jangpung, that's using Jangpung!

Jangpung, or to be precise, the martial arts skill called Igi-eo-tan, was a general term for the technique of shooting tangible and intangible projectiles by emitting and condensing energy outside the body.

It's a little different from the direct strike that jumps over a distance.

Because a gust of wind is something that shoots something out.

Among the martial arts of the Qing Dynasty, the Heavenly Demon Death Ray and the Blood Seal belong to the Jangpung, and the Tathagata God Strike belongs to the Gyeokjang.

In fact, the distance advantage in a fight is a huge advantage that cannot be overemphasized.

In that case, the strongest one would have to be the one who could shoot long-range blasts or master the art of striking.

But if that were true, then all martial arts would have developed in the direction of long-range strikes.

But the reality was not like that, because Jangpung, Igi-eo-tan, and Gyeokjang-gong had huge weaknesses.

The weakness is that the bet costs a lot of money, but the power is still ridiculously weak.

But what about that absurdly weak power? On a cold day, frozen solid, and even in the ground that was so hardened by walking on it, a huge hole was dug?

Either he uses a martial art specializing in long winds, or he has an absurd amount of internal energy.

No, even if it's Hyun-kyung, this is a bit... No, why do I encounter monsters wherever I go?

While Qing grits his teeth, Shiksimma raises his arm high as if he is about to throw a ball.

Suddenly, an ominous, dark red flame forms and burns in the palm of the hand that is neither clenched nor unclenched, as if it is holding something.

As Shikshimma spreads his arms, the soul fire shoots out at a terrifying speed.

It traced a straight trajectory like a taut clothesline, and the sound of the concentrated energy cutting through the air was truly terrifying.

Qing throws herself once again.

Another breathtaking forward roll unfolded. If the masters of Qing's hometown gymnastics had seen this roll, they would have unanimously given it a perfect score of ten without hesitation.

"쥐새끼 같은 년! 잘도 구르는구나!"

"What does that have to do with rolling around with a rat? Have you ever seen a rat rolling around?"

"You bastard! You're all talk!"

"You idiot! You just figured it out!"

Originally, the Blue Snout was a living, breathing monster, even when it was hunched over in the face of the powerful. So, there was absolutely no reason to feel offended by hearing such obvious things.

However, Siksimma feels very bad after being scolded by a young girl who is so young.

And what's more, she's so fast, even if she flies, she'll just take a few steps and then start running again.

On that topic, he flies away from the bullets as if he has eyes in the back of his head, so it's useless to try to keep him at bay, but it only creates distance.

Then, Shiksimma grits his teeth and pushes the bet back with his leg.

Throw away the restraint of the strong wind and start trampling the ground again!

Thump! Thump! Thump! It was a stamina-driven movement that gradually gained momentum with each step taken.

In that case, the distance between Qing and Shiksimma begins to decrease rapidly.

but.

If you could run fast just by continuously kicking the ground hard, why would lightness exist in the world?

The act of running fast by kicking the ground hard was like running at full speed down a hill.

As you gain speed, it becomes harder to slow down, let alone change direction. And once you exceed a certain speed, even maintaining a constant speed becomes difficult.

To avoid falling, you have to push off the ground faster and harder, which leads to more speed. Then you have to kick even faster and harder, which leads to more speed… …It was a cycle of infinite acceleration.

This is something that even the experts of lightness warn against, as if you become intoxicated by speed and become too fast to control, you will end up destroying yourself.

It is a danger that even Qing, who received training as a prospective Shinto priest, is well aware of.

The Shiksimma, caught up in infinite acceleration, gradually gets closer to Qing.

The distance that had been more than ten shots widened to ten shots, then nine shots, then seven shots, then four shots, and then a sinister presence was felt behind my back!

Shikshimma pulls his arm again.

A crimson flame bloomed in his palm, a mass of blood-curdling energy. And finally, he stretched out his arm, holding the completed bullet in his palm.

The moment a lump of extremely compressed energy burrows into Qing's back-

The corners of Qing's mouth are torn all the way down to his ears.

The verb suddenly goes down and disappears.

Because Qing hit the floor with both feet and lay down.

Chii-i-ik, lying down, legs sliding, above them, Siksimma dynamically leaning forward with his arms outstretched.

Qing's eyes flashed. At the same time, he raised the Moonlight Sword he held with both hands with all his might.

The sunset-colored river rises and straightens, drawing a sinister trajectory towards the man's most precious place, between the gaping legs of the Shiksimma.

At that moment, Qing saw Shiksimma's expression.

Two eyes bulging out as if about to burst out of the corners of their eyes, teeth clenched between parted lips, nostrils dilated. The vivid colors of fear, and the same intensity of desperation.

This is why you use lightness, not because you're trying to foolishly use internal energy.

Siksimma suddenly remembers his mother's face.

Long ago, the face of a mother who had promised to sleep for ten nights, but whose eyes were filled with a vivid sense of guilt. It was the expression of a mother who had left her child in someone else's home, back when child swapping and cannibalism were rampant.

And then several scenes come to mind.

The cleaver trembling in front of those who were starving to the point of madness, the Blood Cult warriors I suddenly encountered, the warriors who had been looking up when I first ate their hearts were now kneeling and looking down, the beautiful and pretty teacher's daughter, and the child who was pacing around the yard endlessly while looking at the threshold, and the sound of a child's crying ringing in my ears, that small body, those cute fingers that tightly held my finger... ... , No, is this a kaleidoscope? Am I a kaleidoscope? Don't make me laugh!

The food-loving demon suddenly ground his teeth.

A huge amount of energy emanates from both palms, and the soles of the feet as well, causing the shoes to burst in an instant and then disintegrate into pieces and disappear.

As the wind gusts beyond the limit, exploding in all directions, the backlash twists Shiksimma's waist.

He desperately twisted his body and pelvis to avoid the vicious energy rushing towards the center of the man. It was the most desperate and desperate effort of Shikshimma's life.

And finally.

The Moonlight Sword passes in front of Shiksimma's pelvis.

It was a difference of a single hair.

In fact, the enlightenment of Shiksimma was so shallow that it could not even reach the level of Geomma, the weakest of the Hyeon-gyeong.

However, even so, Geomma assessed that Shikshimma was two steps ahead of him.

Because the heart, raised through a special method, holds energy as great as a famous elixir, and the internal energy of the Siksim Demon who drank this heart like water had long since surpassed the level of Hyeon-gyeong.

In other words, it is simply pushing forward the understanding of the lacking ignorance with the output of enormous internal energy!

But this time, it was different.

It was a miracle that Shiksimma had achieved by unleashing his own potential, and if he could observe his own body and reproduce the movements he had made, it would be a subtle move that would allow him to instantly supplement his lack of enlightenment and raise his level.

However, Shikshimma couldn't do that.

Because the blade grazed the front of the pelvis.

The Shikshimma, who was already running at an uncontrollable speed, even managed to turn its body in mid-air with a miraculous power, causing its body to spin like a top and bounce around five times.

And then the world's most desperate cry erupts.

"Kaaaaaaah!!!!"

The black spot disappeared from the eyes of the Siksimma who suddenly got up, so it looked like he had completely turned around.

But more than that, the gaze is drawn downwards.

The area between his legs was stained with crimson blood, or rather, a red stain that spread in real time.

It's truly an eye-catcher!

Qing's eyebrows furrow, and a groan escapes her lips without her knowing it.

I did it, but, ugh, I can't see it.

In fact, it was a worse result than avoiding it.

Since the Qing Qi could not penetrate the self-defense power that was realized with an enormous internal energy that transcended reality, it would have given up one of the beads on the left or right.

But I twisted my body, twisted my pelvis, and the centrifugal force caused the dangling pillar to be thrown outward.

And the blade that grazed the front of his pelvis, Qing, who was holding the Moonlight Sword, felt a very subtle touch.

Of course, even so, avoiding it was the right decision.

R1o1RUY1V2dWdFByellBWDZwUWJGZUlibHhObkNaaEdvTlpXTmEwV2lqUTh3a0FkWDg1bTNpRVhJajRCWjBncg

When it comes to the pain of breaking a bead or a pillar, the pain of breaking a bead is hundreds or thousands of times more painful.

If the bead were to break, the pain would be so severe that it could kill, so even if only one side had been broken, Shiksimma would have lost consciousness.

No matter how outstanding your internal energy is, you will be powerless once you lose consciousness.

So, Qing could have been the first to achieve the feat of killing Hyeon-gyeong alone.

But the pain of cutting the pillar was only able to be covered by an even greater anger.

Qing, who had seen Shikshimma's completely turned-over eyes, turned away without hesitation. "Well, look at those eyes. If I confront him now, I'll really lose."

On the one hand, it is also a goal achievement.

It seems to have completely lost its mind, so if you run away and exhaust your internal energy, there will come a time when you can really kill it.

I see you're just shooting out a gust of wind, so you'll get tired pretty quickly.

Besides, the wind is nothing to be afraid of in complex terrain, so if you dig into the forest, what are you going to do about it?

As Qing delves into the forest, a man, or rather a man who was once a man, who the Blood Cultists call Seopsimma Hwang, or perhaps now Gojama Hwang, follows Qing.

"Stand there!! Kwaaak! I'll kill you!"

"If it were you, would you stand there? You said you'd kill me!"

"Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!"

Whether it was the power of anger or the rhythm of "death," bullets the size of a child's head were fired alternately from the left and right palms.

However, it was a blue that moved freely through the coniferous forests and thick, tall conifers, typical of cold regions.

The poor pine tree is hit by a bullet and falls down with a loud explosion.

After that, the pillar of the innocent fir tree collapses with its center round and disappears.

The pine tree behind it trembled like a pine tree, but was eventually hit by the bullet and fell down, breaking into pieces.

It was a scene of horrific destruction of nature.

In the meantime, Qing waves his hand angrily.

"You tree killer! You destroyer of nature! Trees are living things, too! Just hit me, hit me! Don't take your anger out on the trees for no reason!"

"Kaaaah!! You bitch! You bitch!!"

At the sight of Shiksimma, who was foaming at the mouth and now firing two bullets with his left and right hands, Qing went "Eek" and ran away again.

But Qing's eyes sparkled.

Perhaps, this time, I can achieve the feat of handling the situation alone.


CHAPTER 930

Even the forest sometimes screams.

Crunch crunch crunch… …! The sound of a tree slowly breaking under its own weight, strands snapping, as it loses the strength to remain upright.

As the beautiful fir tree lies down on the ground, nuts such as pine nuts and pine seeds pour out from the high hollow.

A startled squirrel wakes from hibernation, runs around on the fallen nuts, and lets out a sad cry.

A raccoon that had been hibernating is flipped over and thrashing in a cave hidden by the roots of a nearby pine tree that has collapsed.

Awww, keung keung keung, the wolf and the fox scream in surprise at the sudden noise, and the startled rabbits and field mice run out.

Unfortunately, the screams of these trees continued without ceasing.

If you look down at the current forest from the mountain, you will think that it is a real mess.

With a loud bang, the leaves on the roofs of the forest shook, and the thick deciduous forest's hair fell down in clumps, creating a hollow hole.

Bang! Hood thud, thud, kuung… …! This series of noises continues on and on like a never-ending cycle of songs.

This is truly a scene of horrific destruction of nature!

But now, in the primitive ancient times, the concept of nature conservation did not yet exist, so it was a time when the East and the West rationalized the destruction of nature in various ways.

In the East, being born as an animal is a process where a person commits a sin, pays the price for it, and accumulates virtue. Who would say they're born as an animal? It's because they committed deep-seated evil deeds in a previous life.

The Westerners even said that God had ordered them to destroy nature, eat it, and prosper. Every time he saw people eating all the plants and animals and causing them to go extinct, God was truly pleased.

In this era, only Qing, the only one who has awakened, is able to understand the brutality of this terrible destruction of nature.

In the distant future, nature was beginning to retaliate, and I knew what kind of power it would wield.

However, Qing was too busy to do that.

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTNGlOT0RvV0YrTllqQ0VRT2NOdnRKS2pSUEhsU0hFSUduVlFqNTg1SzBERw

Well, if you stop, you'll die.

"Die! Die!"

In an instant, Qing put strength into his right foot and turned sharply to the left.

Boom! The solid salt water explodes in a circular swirling explosion, blowing out a hole large enough to fit two heads.

The trunk of the tree, which had only half of its length left, could no longer withstand it and slowly began to tilt, and Qing ran again, leaving behind the fallen tree.

"Kwaaah! Dodge again! Why are you dodging?"

The fierce anger that Shiksimma is screaming is now at a level where even intelligence is not felt.

Then should I avoid it or just accept it?

Of course, that means I'm that angry.

"You didn't dodge! You missed it! How could you miss it even though you were standing still!"

"Hold still!!! You moved!!"

"You're seeing things wrong! It's an illusion! Look, it's standing there perfectly still! Guess what it is!"

"You're not standing!!!"

It was a very high-level conversation, with the absolute master of the Talmaji Realm and the youngest and best martial artist in the history of martial arts facing off against each other.

No, isn't that kid tired? He seems to be bleeding quite a bit. Isn't it time he started feeling dizzy?

It wasn't that it wasn't, but the pants were already soaking wet, and the blood had spread along the seam on the inside of the thigh to the side of the knee.

With that kind of bleeding, you should be dizzy and your physical strength should be weakened, but the sight of you constantly screaming and throwing bullets at your opponent is like a freshly caught fish, flapping with energy.

Surely, by the time you reach Hyeon-gyeong, you're immune to bleeding? Just by exerting your full strength with sheer grit and determination, you can squirt blood straight from your bone marrow?

But, even so, it doesn't matter.

I can run forever. No matter how much air power I possess, if I keep running wild and firing bullets like that, I'll eventually reach my limit. Then-

It was a moment when Qing's eyes sparkled like that.

Beep, beep beep beep beep!!

A sudden, sharp sound of a horn.

Kkieeeek!!! Over there, over there! Over there! Let's go!

Immediately afterwards, there were screams and clumsy cries clearly directed towards me.

Soon, monsters begin to rush in from all sides of the forest.

These were monsters that Qing had already encountered.

Were the things running on all fours blood demons, and the ones innocently shouting things like "heart!" or "I'm hungry!" blood demons? Or was it the other way around?

Qing's expression turned sour.

What was even worse was that as these monsters barged in, a glimmer of reason appeared in Shiksimma's eyes, which had been blankly white.

"Come on, you little things! Grab that bitch, grab that bitch! Grab her arms and legs and hang on!"

"Kkieeeek!" "I'm grabbing that bitch!" "Krrr, woof! Woof!" "I'm grabbing her limbs!" "Awww!" "Smell! That rotten smell!" "Kiyaaaaak!" "I hate that smell! Orders? Orders, I'll follow!"

Four-legged mines and two-legged crazy mines rush in from the other side towards the front of the Qing.

He pulled out his Moonlight Sword and shouted venomously.

"Get out of the way!"

Even if I told you to get out, you wouldn't get out. In fact, it was just a gesture of encouragement, and Qingdo didn't really mean to get out.

however?

"Keeek?" "Keeing." "Get out of the way?" "Little master!" "You smell like master!" "Get out of the way!" "We get out of the way!"

The monsters of the Blood Cult were startled and opened up a path to the left and right.

The Shiksim Magic is an extremely evil magic that consumes the heart and drains internal energy, and it is also a means of controlling blood demons and blood demons.

Blood Demons were monsters whose minds were half-collapsed due to their endless hunger and the resulting constant starvation. They were created to subdue their minds and make them follow the owner of the Food-Mind Magic.

Indeed, Qing has already mastered the Shiksim Magic, and his achievements have even reached the ten-star level.

Currently, he is the highest rank, excluding the Siksim Demon, so to the blood demons and blood demons, he is the next in line after the great master, and he has no choice but to be the small master.

What is Qing, who doesn't know these facts? What is his plan? Why are they pretending to listen?

"You little bastards! Catch them! Catch them!"

"Catch it?" "Catch it!" "We're catching it!"

The blood demons rush in.

"go away!"

"Turn off?" "It's going off!" "We're going off!"

The blood demons retreat.

No, only the blood demons retreat.

Among the blood demons who are hesitating and not knowing what to do, the blood demon mines run on all fours and fly with their mouths wide open.

Bloodsuckers are the result of mentally broken failures being transformed into beasts, and for bloodsuckers with the mentality of beasts, orders from above take priority.

however?

"Kkiing! Kkiing! Kkw!" "Eek." "Caw, gurgle." "Guweeek!"

The demons that had been flying towards the blue suddenly started to grab onto each other, biting and hanging on to each other, and fell tangled in the air, gagging, and not only gagging, but vomiting as well, and vomited, desperately struggling to get away.

Like animals that smell the rotten flesh of the stinky lotus, or durian in the Western language, they cover their noses and scream.

It's fortunate that it doesn't stick, but this is still very unpleasant.

"No, these kids."

Qing swallowed the heat that was rising in her throat, and since she was being chased, she endured it for now, but she'll just wait and see about these bastards later.

Rather than that.

Qing stretches out his fingers.

"Catch that, catch your dad!"

"Catch Daddy! I love Daddy!" Catch Daddy? Is that my dad? " "Is that Daddy?" "I don't know! But hold on!"

Then the blood demons rushed at Shikshimma.

The foodie who saw that sight foamed at the mouth.

"You, you little shits, even your own kids are ignoring me? You damn devils, you damn filthy bastards!!!"

The opposite sex, who had been gradually returning to the blood demons he usually found cute, thought that he was being ignored by the blood demons, so he kicked down the door and ran away.

Hmm, that's about it, I guess it could be done.

How would you feel if you brought a dog to guard your house, but when a thief breaks in, the dog happily wag its tail at the thief and runs around with him?

What if, what if, instead, he sided with the thief and ran to bite the owner?

"Die! Die all! How dare you! How dare you!!"

The two arms of the food demon stretch out wildly.

With each rush, the flying bullets spread out without regard for the enemy.

Holes were blown into the trees, holes were blown into the bodies of the blood demons and blood demons, and when they hit the limbs, they disappeared in a circle and the remaining parts poured out onto the ground, spilling red blood.

Meanwhile, Qing carefully lowers her body.

Even in a broadleaf forest, not all trees are broadleaf, so even if it wasn't as much as in a normal forest, there were still fallen leaves that could be found somehow.

Because the layer of fallen leaves wasn't deep, her plump buttocks were slightly exposed, but since the monk couldn't cut his own hair, there was no way for Qing to know, so Qing had done his best to camouflage himself.

"Kwaaaaak!!! You fucking bastards!! Who dares ignore me! No one can ignore me! Everyone, everyone die! Yes, everyone, die!!"

Now, it was a completely exploded Shiksimma, with the Cheonhwageom and everything else.

It seems like the sadness that had built up inside of him was no joke, and if he kept ignoring him and playing the emperor, hmm, maybe he had that kind of inferiority complex.

Well, it's not my job.

Qing watches Shiksimma through the fallen leaves.

At first, he created bullets and threw them by hand, but now, bullets like will-o'-the-wisps created in the air are continuously shot in all directions, causing horrific destruction.

How much time has passed like that?

The surrounding area was completely devastated.

There are no very mature trees nearby, so a large square is created in the forest, and the ground is filled with broken tree trunks and pits, and body fragments of blood demons are scattered everywhere.

And yet, I still feel resentful.

"Kwaaaaak! Where are you! Where are you!"

It is a loud, resounding shout filled with anger.

Meanwhile, Qing quietly gets up.

A slanted standing posture.

The left hand is in the shape of a hand with the index and middle fingers spread out, and the index finger is extended to point to the heart.

As I pulled back the elbow of my right hand holding the sword, the blade of the Moonlight Sword pressed firmly against the abundant breast and aimed at Shikshimma.

It looks like he's holding an invisible bow and aiming a moonlight sword instead of an arrow.

Dokgo Gugeom has a total of nine types of food.

The first half of the three types of food were the fundamentals and foundation of the Heaven, Earth, and Man of the Great Emperor of Mucheon.

Although I have only mastered one of the three mid-level techniques, judging by the fact that I am in the process of dedicating my entire life to deepening the world of heaven, earth, and man.

So, what about the second half of the three meals?

Perhaps it will be a milestone toward some utopia that contains the essence of martial arts that Mucheon Daeje perfected, or that he sought to perfect.

That's why it's so powerful that it's hard to even imitate it with a low-power version, and it's beyond my understanding.

However, the most powerful tool I have, it could be considered a finishing move.

Following the left hand stretched out towards the food demon, the blade of the Moonlight Sword quietly advances.

The speed is not fast.

I just quietly extended my sword.

What on earth is this bizarre act?

From a distance of ten meters, he slowly extended his sword in a large motion towards the enemy.

But, it reaches the enemy. It has already reached them.

Dokgogugeom Chilchosik. Gyeonwolmangji.

If you see the moon, forget the pointing finger.

If my sword touches the enemy, what does it matter what happens? It's not important, so can't it be omitted?

"Cough."

The food demon suddenly vomited blood.


CHAPTER 931

Shikshimma looks down at my chest.

Just to the left of my forehead, between my ribs, a wide slit appeared, and before I knew it, my shirt was soaked.

"……!"

I open my mouth, but no sound comes out because my lungs are not breathing.

And then, with a thud, the food truck collapses from its seat.

The enemy who seemed like he would continue to fire bullets without tiring for an eternity has fallen.

Yeah, since you cut out the heart, you have to search for it, then.

As Qing thinks about this, her legs suddenly lose strength and she collapses.

As both shins turned outwards and the earth was crushed with the full buttocks, a hot, fishy feeling suddenly welled up in my stomach.

The backflow of blood, the blood that has risen up, does not try to hide it but flows straight out.

The original reason why a warrior swallows blood is to keep his condition from being revealed to the enemy.

But it's too much to swallow, and it keeps rising, so if you try to swallow it forcefully and it goes down your throat, it'll be an even bigger problem.

Besides, right now was not the time to worry about hiding the blood that had flowed back.

The right hand holding the sword is trembling.

Since you can't control the tremors of your muscles and tendons, the moment you let your guard down even a little, you'll immediately experience a major cramp, a catastrophe known as a cramp.

It was a precarious situation, like walking a tightrope, just trying to keep my muscles from twisting.

And it's not just the physical body.

The spiritual current that deals with the cosmic mystery bet is also seriously distorted, which is an internal injury called Naesang in the Martial Arts.

The energy meridian connecting the lower abdomen to the right shoulder is tattered, causing extreme pain as if needles are running through it.

Oh, I won't be able to use my right hand for a while.

Well, it couldn't be helped.

What if, back in Qing's hometown, a desk-bound worker whose only exercise was breathing suddenly unleashed the skills of the greatest gymnast in history, performing a triple high jump with one, two, and four rotations before splitting his legs and landing on the floor?

In an instant, your muscles will be torn to shreds, your tendons will be torn and dried up, and your heart and lungs will not be able to keep up, so you will immediately lose consciousness and struggle for your life due to the overload of your respiratory system and heart.

At least Qing's body was beyond human, and his energy pulse also surpassed that of a flower. Even now, his arm has not completely burst off, but is still attached to his shoulder in a tattered state, so it can be considered a great skill.

Well, it wasn't a bad deal, was it?

For the time being, if I seal my right arm and deal with one of the Blood Cult's great demons, well, that's fine.

If someone heard me, they would probably call me a total thug, a shameless bitch with no conscience.

Unless your arm is completely torn off and you have to make some ugly excuse about leaving it behind in the future, it will slowly recover with treatment.

In contrast, the dead remain dead forever.

Ugh, ugh, woof. After coughing up blood three more times, there was no sign of it rising any further.

Qing shifts the Moonlight Sword to his left hand, thrusts it into the ground, and then raises his body with force.

If someone were to look at it, they might wonder why it was flailing around like someone suffering from a cold, when all it seemed was that the right arm was tattered and the energy veins connected to it were twisted.

Even if you work while enduring pain, if you don't show it, no one will notice.

Originally, when my body was tired and in pain, I had to make a joke to let others know about my condition, but in the eyes of others, I would say that Mr. So-and-so was working hard despite his pain, and his evaluation would go up.

So, expressing yourself is a very important part of social life, and more than anything, you can fall into a proud or solemn mood.

By the way, what happened to the peace process?

Will the princess be safe?

I hope the eight warriors are safe too.

But first things first-

Qing stabs the Moonlight Sword into the ground.

And then he lifted his holy left arm and gently stretched it forward, pressing his index finger with his thumb.

The first thing to do now.

That's a confirmed kill!

In the martial arts world, there is an unusually high probability of a miracle occurring where an enemy you thought would die and left behind returns as an enemy.

Why, didn't you say that the daughter of the siksimma, the one who had been blanched and had her skin thoroughly cooked, was alive and well?

One mistake is enough.

Just in case it comes back to life, we should just bury the corpse and cut off its head.

Deeng… …! The sound of the Buddhist temple bell!

It was a very disgusting attempt to crush the corpse of the dead, a martial art imitating the touch of the Buddha.

The moment the violent blow through the air hits the body of the Siksimma, a groan of pain escapes.

"Oh my god!"

At the same time, the food stall that makes you jump up.

No sir, what is this, resurrection? A real resurrection? When it gets to the point where it's like Hyeon-gyeong, you get a bunch of lives, a brief video appears, and then it goes to the next stage and all that stuff, like a herbivore is added?

Qing immediately drew his sword and aimed it.

Then, hehe, it was Shikshimma who tried to make a laughing sound while spitting out blood.

"Hehe, you seem like a vicious bitch, trying to crush a corpse. Was that the hand of that bitch called Jeongpa?"

"I did it to make it easier for wild animals to eat. That's ridiculous. Why? It's embarrassing to get caught pretending to be dead."

"I thought you were fearless, but you're actually quite the coward. Why are you making such a fuss about something that could have been done with just beheading? If you had, it would have been an easy solution."

"I knew you would do that, so I didn't go near you."

Qing answers, looking sharply at Shiksimma's condition.

Both the top and bottom were soaked with blood.

About three inches from the left side of the navel, there was a sharp horizontal tear, exposing the wound inside, and the lower body was cut in a shape similar to the convenient entrance/exit of men's underwear in the hometown, round in the middle. Ugh, I can't see it.

"What was that move just now?"

"The questions start here. How did you live?"

Some might beat their chests and ask why I'm keeping my mouth shut instead of rushing straight into this situation.

For a martial artist, advance and retreat are important matters.

And for that, you have to constantly think and measure your opponent.

I wonder if I can win against this guy, and if I win, will I win completely, or should I risk giving up an arm and a leg and become a cripple, or should I just shut my mouth and save my pride since I can never win?

Is he just bluffing, pretending to be fine? If so, we should attack immediately. Or is he preparing for a final, desperate effort, like a burst of potential or a Donggwijin attack? If so, he'll just stall for time and die of exhaustion.

Or maybe it's not as serious as it appears, so I should just run away without looking back.

In this way, Qing was currently assessing the food, or in the hometown way of expressing it, measuring the angle.

At the same time, it was also a time to recover from my injuries and prepare for what would happen after the conclusion.

And the food was also like a fruit.

This is why conversations often occur even in life-or-death situations when both parties' intentions are aligned.

"How did you live? That's a difficult question. I'm alive, so I'm alive."

"You must have cut out my heart?"

Qing shoots sharply.

R1o1RUY1V2dWdFByellBWDZwUWJGYUl1TVRCVUFjMm4vTFBjam5wRm15T0JrWmp4VUIrQTI0VGdzYi9aREdJag

It was a Shikshimma with such immense internal energy that it could fire a barrage of bullets without getting tired, so I judged that it would be difficult to pierce the bone and struck it from the side.

In fact, it was a sharp stab right next to the navel, between the upper and lower ribs, so half of the left ventricle would have been torn off.

Shiksimma answers him nonchalantly.

"I moved my heart for a moment."

"No, the heart isn't like a finger or toe, so if you move it, it will move?"

"I said it was possible, but if your heart was torn apart, would you be standing here right now? It's not that difficult of a move. Didn't your master teach you how to do it? Well, judging by the way you're acting like you're acting like a fool, you must be a terrible student, even to your master."

"No, you have to make sense."

"Believe it or not, it's up to you. So, is it Jim's turn? What was that blow just now?"

"Oh, that? The Ruyi Bang. No, the Ruyi Sword. Even though my sword looks like this, it was carved from the Ruyi Bang. If you tell it to stretch, it will. But your Ruyi Bang can't stretch anymore, even if you try to."

As Qing answered like that, he realized.

There's no way he'd answer meekly if I asked him, and it's not like this is some untimely game of truth or dare.

He probably didn't move his heart, he just sensed the surprise attack and twisted his torso.

Since the heart is protected by the sacrum, a stab to the side can be easily avoided by simply twisting the torso.

"Hmm. A Ruyi Sword. It doesn't look particularly special, but if such a treasure exists, it should be mine—"

Shikshimma is startled and stops talking.

Because I saw the blue one that was already in position.

This time, he stood diagonally with his right shoulder forward, raised his sword with his left hand, and balanced it by pressing down on the protruding breast with the blade, and the tip of the sword was aimed at him without the slightest wavering.

It was a time to pretend to talk to each other, control my emotions, and prepare for the next move.

However, Shikshimma had to repair his completely pierced left lung, and Qing only had to release the tightly coiled energy in his dantian.

Of course, Qing had to be a few steps faster.

"Okay, there's still one more step left, right? Now, I'm going to stab you in the right side. Even though you avoided the heart, you can't use your left lung, right? If you can't use your right side, how are you going to breathe through your skin? Skin breathing? Well, your face looks a bit like a toad."

"You can't even lift your right arm? Are you confident you can hit me with one blow? If you lose both your left and right arms, will you fight with your mouth next? You're sharp, though."

That was why Qing was cautious.

If you hit it, it kills you, but if you dodge? Once both your arms are in tatters, you can't even run away.

Even in light combat, you have to swing your arms to gain speed. If you try to run with your arms at your sides, you won't be able to run properly.

"Okay. Now, come."

Siksimma says this and smiles.

However, Qing was a natural born old man killer, born with an absolute eye for reading the emotions of the elderly.

In Shiksimma's smile, I read the anxiety, fear, and trembling that Qing could not hide.

This kid, is this a follow-up? You're behind.

The corners of his lips rise with genuine joy.

And then, in an instant, my danjeon swells up.

A prelude to the explosion of compressed internal energy, pushing outward.

Dokgogugeom Chilchosik-

That was the moment.

"Well, sorry to interrupt."

At that moment, a calm, composed voice pierced Qing's ear. Not only was the emotion contained therein insignificant, but the content was also incredibly disappointing.

In the mind, the poison that had been sharply sharpening its killing intent was completely shattered.

"Wow. Brother Yoo, you're badly hurt? Didn't my brother say you needed to hone your skills? You're relying solely on your inner strength to explode, and you're still getting stabbed by a younger, more accomplished junior. Huh, if I hadn't been careful, my heart would've been ripped out. But, why are you bleeding like this? Huh! Huh...!"

A man suddenly barged in, dropped down in front of Shiksimma, and examined his wounds as if he were friendly.

Then, when his gaze reached the lower body of the pillar cut, he was startled and took a step back.

"No, what the heck, is this, cut off? Cut off? Oh my god, is Yoo Hyung, that, that, that, that eunuch? Yoo Hyung is an eunuch! How can he be an eunuch!! Does that mean he can't have any more children!!"

Qing read fear and pity in that voice, yet a very subtle mixture of joy.

A faint hope blossoms in him, yes, I guess they are not close friends.

"Ahem, well, you've already seen your brother-in-law. Even if you only have one daughter, it's not like the family line will be broken if you take a son-in-law in. So don't be too heartbroken."

The intruder says so and looks at Qing.

And then, with a flash of light in his eyes.

"Huh, what on earth trick did you use to turn Yoo Hyung into a half-corpse? You're truly amazing, and I'm not just saying that in vain. I'm truly amazed."

In fact, the eyes were more sparkling than flashy.

It was a curiosity that seemed so overwhelming that he couldn't stand it, and a passion that matched it, his eyes sparkling innocently like a boy exploring.

Qing carefully opens his mouth.

"That, Mr. Gangthalma? Do you happen to know him?"

"Oh, you mean Brother Yu? Didn't I tell you before? I have an acquaintance in Manchuria who's been gnashing his teeth at you. Honestly, you were a bit harsh. Your nephew was on the verge of death. I heard his skin peeled off so much that he couldn't lie down or sit, and he screamed at the slightest breeze."

It was a robber who answered calmly.

Qing's heart sinks.

… … No way, no way? No way, right?

"Um, sir? Do you know that the guy you're talking about is a blood cult bastard, a truly useless bastard who devours human hearts?"

"Oh, that's what you mean? I know it very well. There are so many good cultivation methods, but you have to eat the heart. It's so shameful and pathetic to call yourself a warrior. You're such a pitiful, pathetic, and unsightly brother."

"……."

Behind him, Shikshimma gritted his teeth, but that was all. He seemed to be used to such criticism, having experienced it many times before.

The robber was extremely peaceful, so he was saying that he didn't say anything he couldn't say.

To him, Qing spoke again in a timid voice.

"Uh, then could you step aside for a moment? I'd like to take this opportunity to kill and eliminate the Blood Cult's Great Demon Leader and do some good for the world..."

"Ah. That's becoming difficult."

"Uh, um, uh, why?"

"Well, didn't I tell you before that I have a group I'm a part of?"

And then, he continues speaking in a very ordinary, insignificant way, as if it were small talk.

"I am also a member of the Blood Cult."

Qing's expression, which was the kind one he had tried so hard to keep, was frozen as if it were stuffed.

No, sir, what is this?


CHAPTER 932

I thought he was a bit strange, no, very strange, but he was a human descendant of the Blood Cult?

How dare you deceive me! I can't forgive you!

Seomun-Qing, be angry!

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTN0Iyd29tUFg1cGI5b0w3YURoaGlZMGorTFhmWEpoN0pGaVQ4c2xEemdEbQ

So, Qing said with anger.

"Ah, so you're a member of the Blood Cult. But I've never heard of a robber."

No, well. Being angry doesn't grant you some unknown power or allow you to transcend your limits.

If it were possible to take on two masters of the same level at the same time just because they were angry, wouldn't the martial arts world be training in anger management rather than martial arts?

So, why don't we wait for another time!

I will never forget the anger I feel now, and I will explode in the distant future when I reach my realm and transcend it.

Well, for now, I can only crouch down and plan for the future… … .

"Ah. Among the Blood Cult members, they are called Sword Demons. It's embarrassing to say it myself, but they are called Blood Lotus Sword Demons."

At that moment, Qing was deeply conflicted.

One, two, three? Or not? Still, we're not strangers, but I wouldn't call a convert to the Blood Cult a respectful nickname. But if I don't, I'll end up dealing with two of the Blood Cult's current guards.

How, sir, if you're hesitating, I said to do it!

"Ah, the double-crossing is done." "Bloodlet! Ah, yes."

Well, let me tell you a little earlier… … .

Because of that, the atmosphere became quite awkward.

However, the one who was disappointed with Kangtalma and Geomma's cooperation was Qing, so isn't it the case that the person who was disappointed would bend and join in?

So, Qing gritted his teeth and spoke in a voice that seemed to contain a lot of strength.

"Hey, what's wrong with that? What's wrong with that? You're using that gold horse."

"What is a Tao? A sword. Then what is a sword? A sword. A sword is a sword. A sword or a sword is both swords, but isn't a Doma a bit too arrogant? It seems like he'll start complaining."

"Well, that's true. A sword is definitely cooler than a chopping board. There was a time in the past when swords and swordsmen weren't even distinguished."

"Yeah, that's right. That's why it happened."

"Nicknames are important. Oh, then, sir, could you step aside for a moment? I have some work to do, so let's finish quickly. How about a round of sparring?"

"Oh, that's good, then let's finish this quickly, and then, oh, this is getting a bit tricky."

Miss, it doesn't work.

I tried to let it pass very naturally, but surprisingly, it was the robber and the swordsman who did not lose focus on the situation.

"Instead, how about this? I'm curious about the method that made Yoohyun like this. Show me."

Qing rolls his head tightly around it.

Before, Geomma said that someone he knew was two steps ahead of him. Since that person was Shikshimma, it meant that Shikshimma was on a higher level than Geomma.

Since the herbivore of the Gyeonwolwangji was effective even against the Shikshimma, wouldn't it be equally effective against the Geomma? If we do well, we might even be able to send two Blood Cult leaders to the afterlife right here and now.

But Qing soon changed his mind.

It's not something you can gamble your life on, at least if you can escape, but it's a bit much to spend all your remaining arms on.

So, Qing said again in a gentle voice.

"Sir, I'm afraid my health isn't perfect. Wouldn't you like to see the Ruyi Sword in perfect condition?"

It was Qing who was secretly wagging his tongue to back off, and he was waving a fishing hook called a new skill, a new skill he didn't know about, in front of the sword horse.

"Yeoui Sword! I've never heard of that name before! Are there still some divine skills I don't know about? If so, I can't force you to ask."

"So, can I step back for a moment, take care of myself, and then show you later?"

"Hmm. That makes sense."

"Then, I'll come see you after I rest. I don't need to rest for that long, so around the fifteenth of next month, where should I come?"

"Well, I don't have anything planned for that time, but then, wherever you are-"

"Go! What are you up to, you bastard, Geumma!?"

It was a moment of silence when the food stallion suddenly screamed.

Miss, the flow was good, but that guy broke all the pains… …

"Oh, Brother Yu, how could it not work out? Brother Yu, if you don't get treatment quickly, you'll end up losing the use of one lung. If you want to save even half of your lungs, wouldn't it be better for us to part ways now?"

For some reason, it was the swordsman who took Qing's side.

Oh, maybe I should be a little grateful?

"Don't talk nonsense! What that bitch did to my arrogance, I'll chew her up myself! I'll chew her up, not leaving a single bone behind!"

"Well, even if it's a type, that's difficult. I need him too, and anyway, my nephew is alive, right?"

"What, what!"

"My nephew survived, so that's enough. He's fully recovered from his serious injuries, so that's a stroke of luck. Think of it as a stroke of luck, and just continue with your original mission."

"What are you talking about, you punk?"

"Just think of it as being struck by lightning while walking down the street. Would anyone seek revenge in the face of such a natural disaster?"

"……."

"Those who are alive should live. Let's not continue to cling to such resentment. If we're going to do this, let's go in a positive direction."

The expressionless face of the demon shows his dull eyes filled with deep anger.

Somehow, you have an expression that seems to accuse you of being a creature that should not exist.

Actually, it was a bit annoying.

When you stop your daughter's enemy right in front of you and say something like, "But your daughter is still alive, so it's okay," it's only natural to get angry.

"You're talking about that!! Cough, groan, squeak, croak!"

The demon snarled in a rage before gushing blood. He'd only avoided the heart, but half of his left lung had been ripped out.

It was a martial artist's very mysterious hemostasis technique, using acupuncture to completely block one lung, but in the end, the left lung's airway burst again due to excessive talking.

As Shikshimma groped, he quickly put his hand inside the wound and fumbled around, and soon the blood that had been gushing out violently stopped.

"Look at that. If we don't do anything now, we'll have to remove the entire left lung. If we're going to save even half of it, let's just call it a day, hyung."

There are three bulging tendons on Shiksimma's forehead!

It's so annoying to even listen to, and I even feel a sense of fear at the fact that he's really saying such nonsense.

Does the sword horse not have a human heart?

Well, it seemed like that from before.

"gibberish!"

"I'm not doing this because I'm thinking of you, but even among the regulars, you're already lacking in physical prowess, and if your breathing is also cut in half, you'll be the weakest in the current situation. Are you okay with that?"

"You, you, I'm doing this for my own good, no, it's all because you're good! I've known you for years, but I don't know your true intentions. You're doing this to get martial arts training from that bitch, aren't you just doing this for your own good!"

"I'm alone, are you saying such disappointing things? It's good for me, and it's good for you, too. Isn't it also good for our school? I need to preserve my power—"

"No way! How dare you, how dare you! Put our school in your mouth!? That b*tch! We have to kill that b*tch now! That b*tch, so young, did this to her! She'll be a constant source of trouble for a long time!"

Qing flinched at that.

But the swordsman turned his head.

"Oh, that's right. That's because there are people who rely solely on their internal energy and neglect their training. I've faced them several times, and they're just exceptionally skilled demons for their level. Considering their age, it's surprising, but those who have reached the level of demons have explosive powers in moments, don't they?"

"Of course. If you don't have that kind of explosive power, why would you give up that good harmony and go for the horse?"

Qing quickly joined him.

I am the unseen villain of this martial arts world. How could I miss this opportunity? I won't let you monopolize it all by yourself!

"Well, he doesn't say that either."

"No, shit, you little shit! What kind of bodyguard are you, that bitch!? Or even a teacher!? Why the hell are you taking that bitch's side!"

He was a foodie who would talk about being a king or a soldier, but in the end, he would just blurt out a loud, gruff voice.

Perhaps that's the depth of his being hidden beneath his self-appointed status as emperor. Well, hiding one's depths is natural, and it's not something to be ashamed of, but whatever.

"No, Brother Yu. I'm not suggesting we take sides. Why are you so angry? I understand, given how horrific your nephew was, but please cool your head. Let's look ahead."

"Yes, look far ahead. As Elder Geomma said, we didn't die, we lived. Since we survived, we're okay. Those who are alive deserve to live. If we take this moment as an opportunity and grit our teeth, it could even become an opportunity for growth."

"Yes, you put it well. Brother Yoo, didn't you say the same thing? So, let's call it a day."

"Oh, and you, Siksimma, you need to have a conscience too, don't you see? Isn't it Elder Geomma who's helping you, Yuhyeong? In the first place, Siksimma, you lost to me, you were punished by me. If you lose, you should admit defeat gracefully. Is this how a man should act?"

"That's true. Brother Yoo, you're a man."

"Old Geomma, you're a little late, what's your daughter's name? Yuryang? She's an orphan from today onwards. Wow, Old Geomma saved a niece's life today, really."

"Hmm. I didn't just save Yoo Hyung. I'm saving you too, so prepare one more martial art for our next sparring match."

The beak of terror, double glazing!

"Kwaaaaak!! You little shit! You little shit!!! You, you little shit!!! Ugh, croak, gulp! Weeeeek!"

The food demon spurted blood into this car.

"Oh my, Brother Yu. Calm down, calm down. Heh, open your pulse for a moment and let me draw out your true energy, so calm down, quickly."

Well, what should I say?

If we leave it like this, even Shiksimma will become a Juhwaipma. What the heck, you little punk, you're going to scream until you suffocate.

The enemy of my enemy is my friend, so I seriously recommend that you leave the Blood Cult for the sake of defeating Shiksimma.

Why, back in the day, wasn't there a Boxer Rebellion created by the great hero, Jong Jeong-pil?

Since this is a sect that prohibits the privatization of martial arts and seeks to improve the public realm through shared ownership, joint writing, and joint distribution, it seems like a good fit.

And yet, Qing's fingers were twitching.

When the sword demon declared the Blood Cult, my heart sank and my eyes went dark, but surprisingly, I was able to buy some time, and my right arm, which had been dangling and flailing, was now able to move with difficulty.

It's not far now.

Even if it's not enough to use internal energy, what if it's recovered to the point where you can swing it roughly?

At that time, you can run around here and there and try to figure out how to finish off the demon who has become obsessed with food and has become addicted to alcohol.

Amidst the sinister colors in the center of Qing's eyes,

thud……!

With a light rumbling of the ground, a boulder fell between the two giants and the blue one.

No, not a rock, uhhh.

Qing's expression changed to one as if he had seen a bug crawling on a dumpling, or rather, as if he had seen half a bug left in the dumpling he was eating.

Well, the rocky mass that looked like an iceberg slowly raised its body, so it wasn't low-winged... ...but because it was clearly a familiar face, yet an unfamiliar one was reflected.

No, it's a face I can't get used to even though I've seen it enough, really, how come it looks uglier every time I see it...

It was the appearance of the ugly hunchbacked man, Kim Heo-jung, the owner of the Hyeonmu-mu!

Miss, why didn't I think of that?

If the robber and the black horse had appeared here, then of course this kid could have appeared too.

But even if he had known, what else could he have done?

Anyway, it was a situation where running away was not easy because my arm was in pain.

The best course of action now was to secretly control my internal injuries while adding a few words to the more vicious mental attacks that had no malice and were thus increasing their power.

And above all.

Perhaps, Kim Heo-jung's appearance may not be necessarily a bad thing.

Even if there is a misunderstanding about emergency theft, it is possible to join hands with the public enemy, the Blood Cult.

"You, you, you fucking bitch!"

Oh, wrong.

Qing immediately gave up.

When an introvert explodes, the characteristics are:

I try to prepare a logical protest, but all that comes out of my mouth is a series of ragged breaths followed by a series of clichéd curses.

"Oh, uh, Confucius? Please calm down for a moment."

"You thief! F**k, f**k! From the beginning! From the beginning! You were aiming for the emergency, emergency, emergency! You idiot, you idiot, how the fuck, I, keuheuheup. I could just give it to you, f**k, f**k!"

Tears welled up in Kim Heo-jung's eyes again.

When someone feels so wronged and angry, they might cry. But at the same time, they might also find it difficult to speak.

Qing desperately waves one arm at him. His right arm is tattered, so he's doing the best he can.

"Your Majesty, you've misunderstood! You've misunderstood! It wasn't me who stole the secret, it was Miss Gongryang who put it there without permission. Yes, Miss Gongryang! Yes, where is Miss Gongryang!"

The swordsman blurted out a word to him.

"He ran away."

"Look at that! Miss Gongryang ran away! I told you she ran away because she was being blamed! She's blaming me for all the trouble-"

"No, that guy proposed."

"ah."

The swordsman blurted out another word.

"He just broke through the wall and ran away. Tsk, I never would've guessed he'd look so desperate."


CHAPTER 933

Gongryang Sa-yoon was so shocked by the confession attack that he ran away, breaking through a wall.

"Oh, don't worry about what you said. Your horse followed him, so I'll definitely return the favor to you based on his personality."

"Lu Bu? No, I wasn't worried about Lu Bu. But more than that, I'm really being treated unfairly. I've mastered so many divine arts, why did I have to learn a hunchbacked martial art? Lady Gongryang offered to pack my luggage, so I accepted it, and there was a secret weapon in there."

"It's not a hunchback! It's the real thing!"

"Anyway. It's all a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding. Okay, I'll give you back the emergency supplies right away. Confucius, first, calm down, calm down. Okay, take a deep breath, swoosh, ‘exhale' haaaaaah."

"I, I am now-"

"Okay, follow me. Ss ...

"……."

Kim Heo-jung's distorted expression suddenly changes to a stupid one.

No one will ever know why.

The most likely hypothesis is that the bursting chest of the blue dragon was puffing out even more, as if he was watching closely, fearing that a real explosion might occur.

"Okay, calm down? One more time? Ss ...

Moreover, the voice that came out slowly like the wind while speaking while taking a deep breath, one, two, three parts were sensual enough to be fatal to the man.

"Ugh, uhm."

"Now, Your Majesty, have you calmed down? I know it's hard to believe, but I can tell you that the secret was simply put in my luggage by Lady Gongryang. I didn't steal it."

Taejima, who was originally a hunchback and awkward, would not Geomma refute Kim Heojung, who seemed even more awkward.

"Well, I've known my guy for a long time, and he's the type who's interested in nothing but food. It's a common occurrence when he stays at a house and steals all the snacks in the house. But it's not like he's stealing emergency supplies. Why would he steal emergency supplies?"

Hmm. Miss Gongryang. You were a snack thief.

They say that like-minded people stick together, but a martial arts thief and a snack thief? Hmm. They seem to fit together.

"I don't know about that. He might have left it with me and then intended to give it to you."

"Huh. That guy? That's nonsense."

"Then what is it?"

"What I'm saying is, he has no motive to steal the secret. But what about you? You're a true master of all magic, a true master of the realm. And yet, you're not satisfied with even that, so you've come all the way to this remote, remote corner of the world. You were already prepared to steal the secret."

"No, I told you not to do that, I told you it wasn't me."

"You just keep saying it's not you, but you can't prove it, can you?"

"Ma'am, I didn't do it, so what am I supposed to prove? Asking an innocent person to prove their innocence is just nonsense. There's no other bullshit in the world like that."

"But the evidence that you stole it is quite clear. Isn't the fact that there's a secret weapon in your luggage proof? It's clear, undeniable, undeniable proof that you're the culprit."

"No, but more importantly, why is Mr. Geomma's reasoning, unlike others, plausible at best, but truly unjust? If I die from injustice, will you believe me then?"

Then the swordsman rubbed his chin and said, "Hmm."

"Then that's a problem. Who will pass on my martial arts? Well, come to think of it, if it's not you, then it can't be you. Well, maybe he dropped it there while he was scooping up snacks."

It was a sword that changed its words immediately.

The two eyes of the blue form a horizontal line.

My martial arts? Why is it yours? This old man seems to truly believe he's entrusted his martial arts to me. Seriously, what kind of punk is this? If it weren't for Hyun-kyung, I'd break all his limbs and then twist them like ropes—

"conflict!!!"

At that moment, the swordsman shouted after the lion, and Qing, who had been having somewhat impure thoughts, was startled.

But there was someone who had even more impure thoughts.

"Cough!"

The food demon suddenly vomited blood.

"You, you, you little punk! You should be quiet about what you do, and at the very least, you shouldn't be bothering me, you disgusting little punk!"

"So, you should focus on recovery, why are you making such a fuss? Things are going well, so why are you trying to throw lye into the mix?"

"What the hell is going on! What the hell is going on!"

Qing immediately grasped the situation.

The flow of conversation was so dazzling that I momentarily lost consciousness, and it seemed that Shikshimma was trying to take advantage of that gap to launch an ambush.

The swordsman stopped him, so Shikshimma suffered internal injuries and started vomiting blood again.

But that kid keeps bleeding and still looks healthy. At this age, he's immune to excessive bleeding.

"Oh, my. It's your lack of patience that's the problem. Even now, you see. Because martial arts training is difficult, you've been gnawing at your heartstrings and building up your internal energy. So, even with such formidable internal energy, you're still getting stabbed by a young junior and groaning. I have a solution that satisfies everyone, so all you had to do was wait a little longer."

"Well, what's going on? This bastard really wanted to see me, so I guess he was really excited because he wanted to chase after me!"

The atmosphere is pretty good right now, but I'm also a bit skeptical that the two might fight.

The fact that Shiksimma was cursing only to the point of cursing only once seemed to indicate that he understood that if he fought now, he would inevitably lose.

You were really good at controlling your anger...

"Now, listen. Yu Hyeong says that for the sake of our school's future, we must eliminate the Cheonhwa Sword now and root out the root of the problem. Cheonhwa Sword, you don't want to die, I need to learn martial arts from you, and Kim Awoo wants to indulge in lust by having three concubines with her and four beautiful women."

Kim Aurani? When did you become Aura?

The correct answer is that the swordsman respects the martial artist of the Hyeon-gyeong level and calls his younger brother "hyung" and "younger brother" to express his intention.

A request that doesn't know the circumstances is a complete mess.

This is a total collection of the three plague brothers.

A bastard who thinks he's the emperor while eating people's hearts.

"Ahem, that's right. For the sake of our school's future, that traitor must be slaughtered immediately. But that's not all. He must pay the price for daring to invade my daughter, Mahi."

A thief whose only interest is martial arts.

"Don't worry. There's another way, so don't worry either. Would I let you die? There's a mountain of martial arts to be gained."

And a hunchbacked brat who is crazy about women but doesn't know his place and is picky.

"Ahem, no, lust? I absolutely do not have such impure intentions. I simply wish to fulfill my simple dream of living a long and sweet life, sharing true love with someone I truly understand."

It's like saying "Hyung, dongsaeng" or "Peach Garden Oath" under a peach tree. What kind of Peach Garden Oath do these kids have?

Those bastards broke off the peach tree, the dogwood tree, and the dogwood tree and formed the Three Brothers of the Dog Disease Oath, really.

"So, let's do this. Cheonhwageom, you marry Kim Awoo and settle down in our school. You won't be a hindrance to our school, so Yu Hyeong will be satisfied. As for me, I can visit you when the time comes and receive martial arts training, so I'll be satisfied too. Kim Awoo, who has married the most beautiful woman in the world, will be satisfied, and you'll be able to live, right?"

"What the hell are you talking about! Considering what that bitch did to Aryang, even tearing her to pieces wouldn't be enough. At the very least, she should be given the same pain. No, grudges are repaid tenfold. At the very least, she should be boiled ten times over—"

"Oh, Brother Yoo. That would be a fitting revenge, but think about it. Is it causing you pain?"

"Uh, um?"

The swordsman winks at Kim Heo-jung.

Then Shiksimma looked at Kim Heo-jung.

And then they nod their heads at the same time as if they were trying to squeeze it.

"Haha, that's okay. I guess I'll be fine."

It was Kim Heo-jung who suddenly elevated the match between 'Boiled Ten Times' and 'Getting Married' to a close match.

"No, what? Who cares? Rather-"

As he was about to bite his tongue and die, Qing suddenly came to his senses.

Now is not the time to lose your temper, and there is only one way out of this situation.

There is no one else but the ugly Kim Heo-jung.

No matter how ugly and hunchbacked Kim Heo-jung is, a womanizing brat, picky and dirty, he will never join the Blood Cult.

The Blood Cult is a public enemy that even the human butchers of the Sapa are scum and have been slaughtered.

"Ahem, wait a minute. Kim Daehyeop, the sect they're talking about is the Blood Sect, a group of evil cultists who seek to drown humanity in blood. They're not the kind of people a noble scholar like Kim Daehyeop should be associated with. I don't know what kind of sweet talk they used to lure Kim Daehyeop, but—"

"Hmph. You're the one who suddenly changed your expression and started talking nonsense when things got tough. Drowning humanity in blood? That's a common lie you despicable Zhongyuan bastards tell when you subjugate innocents. The Blood Cult isn't that kind of cult. They simply have a greater purpose: to exterminate those verminous Zhongyuan bastards and establish a paradise on earth where everyone can be happy. Isn't eradicating those ferocious, filthy, petty, and evil Zhongyuan barbarians truly beneficial to the world?"

Oh, that's right. This kid was a Zhongyuan hater.

Ugly. Hunchbacked. Womanizing. Difficult. Vulgar. And on top of that, racist? Ouch.

"It's useless, so give up. Kim Awoo has decided to become the new leader of the Blood Sect, and he has the power to seduce any woman in the main sect. So, if you want to seduce Kim Awoo, you, Cheonhwageom, will have to bring in even more women than he does. Is that possible?"

The new leader of the Blood Cult!

Chugopma (Ugly Hunchbacked Madu) Kim Heo-jung!

The expression on his face suddenly turned sour.

No, I'm going crazy. Seriously.

"What, unlimited women? You got that crazy offer all by yourself? Seriously?"

"No, no! As I said, I'm moved by the cause of eradicating you Zhongyuan parasites who are disrupting this world. I don't care about that woman. It's not like I'm going to stop a woman who admires me, but..."

If you keep your words vague, you will lose all persuasiveness.

This guy is so transparent.

Well, to convince this kid.

Even in the midst of all this, I find the swordsman who is looking at me with his arms crossed, looking so confident, very annoying.

As if to say, if you can persuade them, try it.

Qing sighed deeply.

I really hate it, but if I'm going to deal with this guy, I guess I'll have to get down to his level...

"Confucius? You clearly told me you seek natural encounters. Didn't that mean you wouldn't tolerate false love based on status, wealth, or ability?"

"Huh. Anyway, true love like that requires three people, and even if it's fake, I can fully accept it, so you can just take me as your concubine."

Hmm. It's really not easy... ... .

Qing uses force to keep his head still as it tries to turn around on its own.

The black horse underestimated the blue horse too much.

The tongue of the swordsman is quite sharp and can stab the mind, so it is a famous sword, but it can also be called poison.

The Qing tongue wasn't just good at inflicting wounds. It gently twisted and achieved its purpose.

This is the most deadly poison!

"But, Confucius, would those drunken women really be chaste?"

"What!? What do you mean? The women who come to me are all just like me, prostitutes?"

This kid has a victim mentality, no, he's had a victim mentality all along.

"That's not it. Didn't you say, Elder? A single-headed man can take any woman from the Blood Sect. There are quite a few single-headed men in the Blood Sect. Do you think they would have left such a beautiful woman behind? No, that's right."

I feel so ashamed that I have to say things like this in my life…

However, apart from the misery of the Qing -

The effect was amazing!

"Huh? That, that is……."

"Your Majesty, the Blood Cult is a vicious cult. Would any sane group lure people in with an unlimited supply of women? They'd lure them in and then discard them later."

"No. Anyone who hates the Zhongyuan is our comrade, and anyone like Kim Awoo is a great warrior who deserves to be respected and treated with respect. I swear it on all my martial prowess."

The swordsman intervened to see if it would work.

However, the corners of Qing's mouth were raised.

"No. Even if what I told you wasn't a lie, he would never want to give up a truly beautiful and virtuous woman. For example, Princess Siksim, also known as the most beautiful of the bloodlines? But wouldn't he want to send such a true beauty to Prince Kim?"

"You bitch!!! How dare you say that name! Absolutely not! Absolutely not!!! How dare you! How dare you!!!! Keuk!"

Shikshimma vomited blood again.

It was a truly boiling cry.

"See, I told you I'd never give you the true beauty of the Blood Cult. That's the Blood Cult's characteristic: deceiving people."

"Is that true? Are you fooling me?"

R1o1RUY1V2dWdFByellBWDZwUWJGWWZ1eUdRSFhBdUtLdjErTGovTGRjTTMxY1JKWXJscmwyL0ZCeldaZzFBSA

"No, no, that's not true. Ryang-ah is that, uh, that guy's daughter. What kind of father would say yes if you suddenly asked him to give up his daughter?"

"And, there's also a person in the Blood Sect called Unyeonyeong, who was once one of the five beauties of the Moorim Five Flowers, or the Zhongyuan. Could you please ask her if she'd be available?"

Whether Yuryang is the most beautiful woman in the blood sect or Unyeonyeong was originally a martial arts master, who does Qing care?

But what else can you say when your mouth is open? The moment you start talking about purity, you've already abandoned your mouth.

"Really? Unyeonyeong? Is there such a person? A martial arts world?"

"Well, that's the point. Congressman Un is a single-minded person like us. Unless he wants it himself. But, um, it's best to give up. Congressman Un has such a formidable older sister by his side, even you can't guarantee your life. She's a woman no man can match."

"Sister? Pretty, no, is that sister really that beautiful? A man can't compete with her."

"No, that's not it. Sister, no, younger brother, are you curious about that? That's what they say about being difficult to deal with."

As the swordsman was unable to continue speaking, he clenched his fists. Even the world's greatest swordsman couldn't hide his frustration!

How scary! What a nerd!

Meanwhile, Qing stabs him again.

"Look, they say real beauties don't make it. Yeah, that's right, Lady Gongryang is pretty too. Ask Lady Gongryang if she's okay with it!"

"……Really?"

"That's right, he's not affiliated with the school. He's an outside collaborator, you could say. I don't know if he's a good guy."

Kim Heo-jung's face was distorted... ... Did he lose?

I'm not sure because it was originally distorted.

Maybe it's really distorted.

"No, then what the hell is going on!"

"You can do it, bro, why are you talking like that? If you talk like that, you'll lose your level."

"You told me so! If you become a single master, all the women of the Blood Sect will truly adore you and rush to you! But some people won't, and some won't!"

"Well, calm down, bro. It's not like it's impossible. If you like it, then why shouldn't it be? And there's no such thing as a law that says men and women can't be together, so if you win my heart—"

"If you're trying to win someone's heart, what's the point of a blood sect or a single-minded person? After all, there's no way any woman would like such an ugly sight! If that's the case, why join a blood sect?"

Ugly guy, explode!

Well, it's really ugly when your true feelings come out when you explode...

On the one hand, I feel sad.

In the end, I concluded that I would not be loved because of my appearance.

Even if he was born so ugly, it would be a shame and not anyone's fault, and even if he was deceived and twisted by his teacher, it would be even worse.

What can I do about my appearance?

Of course, looks aren't everything.

There are definitely cases where an ugly man and a pretty woman, or a handsome man and an ugly woman, date and are happy together.

There were plenty of ways to improve even if your looks weren't that great, so, um, no.

If you think about it, it seems like even the ugly guy put in a lot of effort, from his vocal skills and polite demeanor to his amazing cooking skills that can be seen in his snacks.

There's a huge wall that I can't overcome no matter how hard I try. I wish it were a bit more comically ugly, and that plastic surgery exists in the Zhongyuan.

Suddenly, Qing's mind flashed.

Isn't it? It's not plastic surgery, it's plastic surgery.

That too is so effective it's crazy.


CHAPTER 934



There is a saying that there are side effects.

A side effect is an effect other than the original intended result, so it is called a side effect.

Many people understand this as a bad effect and don't use the word "부不", but a side effect is when an unintended result, whether good or bad, occurs.

A prime example of these side effects is the aphrodisiac taken in the Qing Dynasty's hometown. Originally, it was a prescription for making the heart beat faster, but after making it, it somehow made the lower body stronger? It didn't kill me?

anyway.

Martial arts, big or small, are bound to have side effects.

Among them, there was a series of martial arts that had a beauty-enhancing effect due to side effects, and these were collectively called the Fairy Art.

In fact, even though it's called a "Fairy Gong," its effects aren't all that impressive. It just smooths skin texture, removes blemishes, smooths out wrinkles, and brightens complexion.

However, in all things in the world, even if they are classified as the same, there are bound to be things that stand out at the extremes.

An amazing new skill that takes the Fairy Princess to the extreme.

That was the Taeeumoknyeo Shingong.

This efficacy is guaranteed by Seol Ga-ryeon, the owner of Seolga Sanghoe. Who in the world would have thought that the seductive hostess of Daumdaun Sanghoe would actually have something vicious hanging from her lower body (this is Seol Ga-nom's one-sided claim and there is no evidence)!

However, since the original version of Seolga was not bad, the effect must have been surprising.

But the ugly guy, oh, oh, what a pity… … .

But since my current face is definitely not a human face, wouldn't it be better to at least make it look like a human?

But, even if it is the Taeeumoknyeo Shingong, can it be saved?

What if adding femininity here doesn't make him pretty, but instead turns him into a grotesque cross-dresser like the eunuchs in the palace?

Wouldn't it be even more distorted and twisted, becoming a more twisted and ugly man of the underworld?

Even if Qing tries to get an estimate, it's such a mess that it's impossible to estimate at all.

Meanwhile, the hunched man was breathing heavily. His shoulders were rising and falling, his face was flushed and blue, and he looked as if he might burst into tears if left alone.

The atmosphere was so solemn that even the most vicious demons did not dare to open their mouths, and looked at the ugly man with half disgust and half pity, or rather, about the same amount of sadness.

"Okay. I really shouldn't be associating with you fucking scumbags from the Zhongyuan. You fucking bastards, you fucking idiots, you fucking idiots who just mess with someone and look at them like they're retards, you fucking bastards..."

In that moment, Qing came to his senses.

Come to think of it, did that ugly guy do something big wrong?

Kim Heo-jung, who had been deceived by his teacher and had a distorted appearance, had long ago given up and was living quietly alone at the foot of Baekdu Mountain.

It was Qing who went to find the magician.

He rushed at me, saying he was the only one who had misunderstood and felt betrayed, and that he would kill me with his hatred for barbarians. While that was certainly a sin, it's impossible to know whether he truly intended to kill me or to beat me to drive me out.

Considering that his bad deeds are 87 points, and his appearance is what makes him a failure as a human, but his bad deeds are what makes him a passing human, it's possible that he didn't really rush in with the intention of killing him, but rather that his inferiority complex exploded.

Of course, in the subsequent confession attack, it would be a bit ugly if you were to become wrapped up in an inferiority complex.

Aside from that, the one who ended up having the emergency supplies stolen was Kim Heo-jung.

The person is just a little, no, very ugly, ugly on the outside and ugly on the inside, but he just boldly reveals his ugly insides that are usually unknown.

Meanwhile, Kim Heo-jung turns around and walks off somewhere.

The back of his head was truly pitiful… …not really, but rather the hunchbacked figure, whose back was like a majestic iceberg, receding into the distance, so he didn't look particularly pitiful, but anyway.

"Hey, Kim, where are you going?"

"No, fuck! I'm going home."

Qing, Shiksimma, and Geomma thought at the same time.

That guy is upset. That guy is upset. He's upset.

Then the swordsman shouts urgently.

"Kim Awoo. I'm the kind of person who would never lie, even if it meant dying. It's for no other reason than that. If I were to lie and get caught, I'd suffer even more. It's far more beneficial to tell the truth from the start."

"So what, what do you want me to do?"

"So what I said to Kim Awoo wasn't a lie. Those whom Cheonhwageom spoke of were entrusted with important responsibilities within the Sinbon Sect, so they weren't included among my women from the beginning."

"All women?"

"Still, we should exclude the single leader and the women he cherishes. Isn't that right? If you've brought in a woman, does that mean other single leaders can just take her away as they please? Shouldn't single leaders show some respect to each other?"

"……."

"There are plenty of other women, so use them all however you like. You can change them every day, or you can treat them harshly. No one will dare say anything to Danju. As long as you don't get caught by your older sister, that's fine."

"No need. Those bitches will probably say I suck anyway when they see my face. You bitches who only care about the ashes, you won't take it even if I give it to you. Just throw it away."

It seems like his mind has completely left.

Qing rolls his head again.

Well, things aren't that bad.

The swordsman is on the side of letting me go, not because he's thinking of me, but because he wants to learn more martial arts. It's purely selfish of him to do it for his own good, but in any case, it's beneficial to me.

That damn Siksimma is making a fuss about killing me, but what can he do about it?

In a situation where one lung was completely cut off, and he even vomited blood several times, it was already considered a failure to treat the patient.

The lawmaker who saved the princess who was decapitated is caught, but didn't the swordsman clearly say that if things continued like this, the weakest member of the current police would be taken by the Shiksim Demon?

In other words, now Shiksimma was the weakest in the current situation.

But, you have to kill him while you can, that blood cult member who is like a worm, and he is a single person at that, so if you don't kill him now, you never know when you'll get another chance.

Qing followed Kim Heo-jung's back with regretful eyes.

If the ugly guy helps, I might be able to kill him.

If I do well, I can even take down that annoying leech and martial arts thief.

But, that can't be the case.

Because that's not right.

The Blood Cult tried to use the ugly man by enticing him.

Even if I try to lure him with nice words by saying I'll kill him now, I'll only end up on the same level as the Blood Cult.

From the beginning, he was a person who lived cut off from the world.

You can't take responsibility or be responsible for it, yet you're dragging me out just because you like me?

That was not right.

That won't do.

You can't trade with the Taeeumoknyeo Shingong.

If only Kim Heo-jung's appearance could be made human-level, but there's a possibility that he could be made more monstrous by adding femininity to it.

However, one thing must be made clear.

"Excuse me, Prince Kim."

"Why, what."

"I'll return the money. I didn't really intend to steal it, did I? Actually, I'm not even sure if Lady Gongryang put it in, but it's a rough guess, but it could have been something she stumbled into while grabbing a snack, as Elder Swordsman said."

Of course, it is absolutely certain.

Anyone who hears that you put in a special gift or that you have prepared a way to live for yourself will know that you did it on purpose.

But the special gift might have been some really delicious yakgwa made by Chugopnam, and the way to buy it might have been to look at the wall in advance to see what kind of escape route to take.

"Okay. I don't need it."

"but."

"You don't need it, so burn it or eat it, do whatever you want. I'm sick of it now. This fucking martial arts. Fuck, really fuck..."

Kim Heo-jung's voice is really curt as he answers, he's completely upset, um.

However, Qing calls Kim Heo-jung once more.

"Oh, and Confucius."

"Oh, what is it! Why!"

"No, I just wanted to apologize. I felt like I bothered you by coming here for no reason."

"……it's okay."

"Confucius?"

"Oh, why!"

Kim Heo-jung suddenly turns around in anger.

Suddenly, the world disappears.

In martial arts, there is a skill called the union of the sword and the mind. When the presence of the sword surpasses that of its owner, the owner cannot be seen because they are looking at the sword. There is no martial artist, and only one sword remains.

By the same principle, if the beauty of that face transcends the world, you cannot see the rest of the world because you are looking at the face.

If your face represents the world, then let me say it: the beauty of duty-free unity!

Qing, who had kicked away the cotton thread, bowed his head politely.

"I'm so sorry. I really am."

"……."

Kim Heo-jung, who had been standing silently for a long time, soon turns around again.

An optical illusion that makes it seem like the shoulders are drooping infinitely, with the back sticking out like an iceberg.

Like that, Kim Heo-jung's back disappears into the distance.

After a while like that.

Qing bowed her head to Geomma as well.

"Well then, sir, I will go in now."

"What!? Where are you going, you bitch!? Luggage allowed-"

"Shut up. Why are you deciding that? If you don't want to lose, just shut up. You're talking too much when I'm the one who's being criticized. Losers keep quiet, right?"

The strong are weak and the weak are strong, I bow my head only to the strong!

A cruel and destructive human being to the weak, that is the Ximen Qing.

Where the weakling opens his mouth?

"What, what, what is this……! Ugh, ugh."

My stomach is starting to ache, and I'm starting to feel my internal turmoil rising again, so I'm grabbing my chin.

Qing turns her body leisurely.

So, in the end, well, I shouldn't even look at Jangbaek at all. It's really annoying.

however?

"Stop. I've changed my mind."

The swordsman's voice holds the Qing.

"Huh? Sir?"

"Come to think of it, was it really necessary to let you go? I could have just brought you to the main school and trained with you."

Sword Horse, change your mind!

Miss, why is this kid suddenly acting crooked again?

But Qing was a skilled squirrel, and he knew well the virtue of humility, of knowing how to bow down before the strong.

"Oh, sir? Normally, when you go fishing, you release the fish you catch. Then they'll grow up and come back. If I release them, won't they grow up and come back?"

"No, what Yoo Hyung said is right. You're too dangerous, and you already know enough about the Jeongpa's divine powers."

"Oh, don't you know you can't force yourself to take martial arts? If I just recite fake phrases, you'll get possessed by the spirit of the devil?

"If you cooperate, I promise you a comfortable life. If your relatives and friends are still alive after the conquest of the Zhongyuan, they will do the same. However, I cannot tolerate you attacking me during the conquest."

It was a very sincere proposal.

From the Blood Cult's perspective, it was a truly generous offer.

But, what do you know?

"You know it won't work, right? I would have rather just died."

"It's not like there's any real difference. Even if I let you go, I'll never pass on the important secrets of the sect."

Isn't that a natural thing?

In the days when I didn't know the martial arts world, I wonder if I wouldn't have known when I would fearlessly strike the Emperor's Sword with the Tathagata Goddess in the Sosu Demonic Clan.

Qingdo Now, the sect had a vague understanding of the meaning of their martial arts, even if they didn't fully understand it.

"You're going to do it now, aren't you? I don't know about you, but are you going to take that weak old man over there with me no matter what? Are you going to kill Shiksimma? Are you going to let him die? Are you going to turn my niece into an orphan?"

"Well, I don't think so. After you left, I called my disciples back."

"ah."

somehow.

Even though his right arm was recovering, and he must have known him, I thought the three brothers with the disease were suffering from the disease.

Why? Because I wasn't the one who would benefit from stalling.

So, Qing needs to buy more time.

I was confident in my ability to escape, so if I stalled a little longer, I might be able to somehow break through.

"Oh, sir? How could someone so unmanned forcefully use his own weapon against others with such lethal force? How could that be?"

"Really? Then you fight me."

"I'm Hwa-gyeong, and you're Hyeon-gyeong. Can an adult compete with a child?"

"Let me get this straight. How do you think I'm the same as Hwagyeong? I didn't rise to the top easily like you, so please respect me. Well, you, a great man, might be worthy of the title of Hwagyeong."

"Miss, I told you not to do that."

"There's no need to waste any more time. Don't you know what I'm up to? My disciples have probably prepared a trap, so even if you escape in good health, there's no guarantee."

He's like this old man who's so stubborn.

While Qing frowned-

"Guys, it's training time. I should've done more capture training. Well, since we're just keeping them alive, it doesn't matter if we cut off their limbs."

Even if he pretended to be moderate, the leader of the Blood Cult was still the leader of the Blood Cult, so the sound of leaves rustling approached from all directions.

It would have been better to just rush in quickly, but isn't it a truly difficult situation to have the blood cultists holding nets watching with tense eyes from afar?

A net, these bastards, these unmanned bastards, they really need to get rid of all their peppers. Those bastards.

"Well, I'm sorry to have to do this, but I'll be going. Brother Yoo, please take care of your internal affairs. This is an event of our Jonggeomdan, so even Brother Yoo cannot interfere. Do you understand?"

R1o1RUY1V2dWdFByellBWDZwUWJGWWZ1eUdRSFhBdUtLdjErTGovTGRjUEFzM2IwWGRDSmw1L1ptdUxPWnczdQ

"……Okay."

Then, the swordsman smiled sinisterly at Qing.

"Okay, then, let's play."

Qing grits his teeth and strikes his sword.

That was the moment.

"for a moment!"

What is this voice!?

Qing's head suddenly turns.

There, perched high on a tree, was a person… …an unusual figure.

The ugly guy who left because he was upset, Kim Heo-jung! He's back!

The majestic peak rising behind, the face backlit, you could say that the face looks better backlit.

Qing makes a happy expression.

"Prince Kim! Could it be that you have come to help!?"

At that, Kim Heo-jung's face distorts into a smirk.

It looked really mean because it was so ugly, but, well, still, I guess he tried to put on a cool smile, right?

"No. I came back because I thought I might never have another chance like this again. Isn't it dangerous? Just spend one night with me, and I'll help my lady."

Ah, this kid, that mean smile was right.

Qing's expression suddenly turned sour.

Now, he doesn't even hide his ugly and vile intentions.

What, what, why did this kid suddenly turn dark and appear?


CHAPTER 935

People tend to become speechless when they're so shocked. But people don't always communicate their thoughts through words.

Eyebrows furrowed and pressed together, deep furrows between them, eyes that look like they are looking at a bug that has been chewed, lips parted as if saying 'Ugh', teeth slightly revealed, and the corners of the mouth turn down.

Since Qing's facial features were already well-defined, and his expression was clearly visible, the emotions contained in his expression were obvious to anyone who saw them.

Horrible! Contemptible! Pathetic! Disgusting!

Kim Heo-jung quickly made an excuse.

"But! If not now, how could I possibly have the chance to sleep with a peerless beauty like you? Even if I worked my whole life and had a hundred strokes of luck, it would be impossible! So how could an ugly guy like me ever hold a peerless beauty?"

But since it didn't sound like an excuse at all, Qing's eyebrows lowered even further.

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTN2JacE1Jdy8vQnpOaVRiZXAreEVuS09BT28zeldEVkFoeTVCNlRYN0ZGMg

Kim Heo-jung averted his eyes and coughed in vain.

"Then, I'll help you, but in return, just touch my chest once, just a little bit…."

"No, what? Are you saying we should just leave now? Still, you sound cool and have a respectful demeanor, so you're acting classy."

"Well, since it's all been revealed anyway, now we know exactly what kind of guy he is……"

"Now that you've seen the bottom, you have no intention of packing it up anymore?"

"Then, I'll just touch you halfway, halfway. There are many women in this world, but a woman with a full chest is extremely rare and precious. Please, if you truly think of it as saving this poor thing, I'll live with that memory for the rest of my life, okay?"

It was a condition that suddenly became significantly relaxed as the breasts came down to half an angle overnight.

I'm not sure if he knew or didn't know the law of negotiation: ask for big conditions first, then offer small conditions, and ask for unreasonable conditions first, then offer acceptable conditions.

That was the moment.

The swordsman's eyes lit up, so he thought this was the right time to intervene.

"Well, Kim, there are plenty of voluptuous women in our school. What's a half-moon? If it's your will, I can just massage you for the rest of my life, until you're completely crushed—"

"Shut up!!"

However, before he could finish speaking, Kim Heo-jung suddenly lost his temper and scolded him in a stern voice.

"If I had been forced to do this, I would have broken my vows long ago! That would be unacceptable! What kind of woman would give her heart to a man she forcibly took, and how could her daughters truly follow their father? You devilish Zhongyuan bastard, I almost fell for your sweet talk for even a moment and ended up in misery myself. That alone is shameful!"

It's a statement of some conviction.

Qing is speechless.

No, what? You said you'd spare my life, so just give it to me. Then, wouldn't that make it not forced?

Is it a mutual agreement whether you want to die or sleep with me?

Judging by his expression, the swordsman also looked very dumbfounded.

But, as expected from a long-time Nomadou, he quickly regains his composure and makes another offer.

"Well, then there's nothing we can do. After all, Kim Awoo's martial arts are on par with the Cheonhwageom. There's nothing to regret. So, why don't you back down now? Even if you antagonize our school, it'll only make things harder for you. After all, you're not from the Zhongyuan, so you're not our enemy. So, why bother?"

That moment.

Thud! The harsh sound of footsteps trampling the earth. The swordsman's body shot diagonally. At the end of the trajectory of the blue martial arts uniform, which left a long tail, was Kim Heo-jung, standing on a tree branch.

The Sword Demon's dastardly surprise attack!

He suddenly attacked me while I was saying I would let him go. As expected, the great demon leader of the Blood Cult was a piece of trash that was easily disqualified from being human!

The swordsman had already faced Kim Heo-jung. Knowing his inexperience in combat, he knew he wouldn't be able to handle a surprise attack like this.

And indeed it was.

As the swordsman flashed his sword, Kim Heo-jung, with his eyes wide open, stared blankly upwards, watching the trajectory of the strong energy falling on him.

That was the moment.

The swordsman's heart tightened. Every single hair on his body felt stiff and prickle. His joints tingled, and the tendons attached to his bones felt as if they were about to give out without his knowledge.

At that moment, the swordsman's eyes turn.

The appearance of the Cheonhwageom standing on the other side.

The swordsman had also anticipated that the Cheonhwa Sword would not tolerate a surprise attack.

When I fought against the Cheonhwa Sword, I realized that his skill was not something that came from learning various martial arts, but rather a skillful form of fighting that I couldn't tell if it was innate or learned through countless battles.

However, the distance is sufficient, so I won't be able to reach my original speed with my uncomfortable arms, and the shock field of the Buddha's divine skill, Tathagata's Body, is quite annoying.

Just hit him once.

Anyway, without Kim Heo-jung, the Cheonhwa Sword would be like a fish already caught, and the power of the Gyeokjanggongjang wasn't that threatening to the Hyun-kyung's unmanned personnel in the first place.

However, it is not a factory.

A strange posture with the blade held upright in front of the face.

It's a look that's completely unsuited to combat, and it's closer to a way of showing respect with a sword.

But some sense, some profound sense, was screaming at me to stop it, that it was truly dangerous, the tightening of my heart, the goosebumps all over my body, my bones and tendons were ringing alarm bells.

The old warrior did not ignore his intuition.

He twists his waist forcibly, and with the recoil, he twists his body, and simultaneously unleashes countless downward strikes of the White Lotus Sword that he has been repeating until now.

The first herb on Baekryun Island, Yeonryeongchangpa.

The continuation of training is like the waves that come crashing down.

The sword of the demon slashing through the air met a ray of starlight that had suddenly appeared, causing it to bounce violently. Ground!

However, countless downward strikes follow, and soon, the swordsman's path repeatedly strikes with countless afterimages as it encounters a straight, penetrating force.

Tadadadadadadadang!!

A sound like several people hitting an iron plate.

The stabbing energy breaks and falls apart.

The sword horse is pushed back by the recoil and lands.

But his expression was filled with joy.

"Excellent! What was that just now!? That herbivore, that martial art!? What the hell was that technique!?"

"Oh, this?"

He takes a deep breath and lowers his left hand, which is holding the sword.

"To explain this herbivore, I have to tell you about my past wanderings. Where was it? Around Cheonjasan Mountain, I think. I was originally wandering deep in the mountains in search of an elixir, but I got lost. Back then, I bought six portions of Byeokgokdan and took them with me. If I couldn't find the elixir by the time I finished it, I was going to die. If I didn't find it, I thought I'd just sleep through tonight and sleep forever tomorrow. So I went into a cave..."

"No, that's enough! What is that martial art?"

"No, here's where it gets important. I went into the cave, and when I looked closely, I saw letters. Ah! This is what I've been given! So there was a secret stash there, and the letters were written right on the sign! Isn't that right?"

"Yeah, so what! So what is it!"

Qing answered him with a serious expression.

"I won't tell you."

The correct answer is Dokgo Gugeom, a herbivore, non-poisonous general.

It's nothing special, but it's a surprise attack full of poison that stands there in a cool pose for no reason, and then suddenly shoots a destructive beam.

Why are you telling me that?

And I wasted all my time.

"What?"

"You bastard! How dare you!"

Qing saw Kim Heo-jung on the tree taking a strange pose.

Spread your legs wide, bend your knees at right angles, and extend your arms to the left and right with your elbows bent at right angles. What kind of posture is that?

In that state, he shook his head forward and backward, lifted his right and left feet alternately, and shook his fists left and right, clenching and unclenching them.

The act of performing specific movements to the beat.

Ah, this is called dancing.

Well, the Blue Dragon Dance of the Blue Dragon Dancer had the elegance of a Blue Dragon, and the Hopi Woman's Jujak Dance had the fierce momentum of a fire rising like a flame.

I understand why the Hyeonmu dance is said to represent a turtle, but how on earth has such an ugly dance been passed down until now?

Anyway, in line with the declaration of not informing the Qing, white ice shards begin to rise from Kim Heo-jung's body.

"You vile bastard! I'll kill you!"

Boom! A loud noise comes from behind.

The reason I heard it from behind was because at the same time, Qing turned around and ran away.

The startled expression on the blood cultist's face, unaware of the rapidly approaching figure, soon gritted his teeth and lifted the net in his hand, and the moment it spread wide,

The new Qing Dynasty is divided into eight parts.

A disciple of the Sword Demon, a blood cult member who turns around without hesitation, as if he had already seen the Neungpa Mibo.

But Qing also expected that much.

After the net was spread, the aftereffects of the Nungpa Mibo were much more serious, so why wait and then take action?

Because the front blood bridge and the left front blood bridge were now at the same angle.

Qing, who appeared from behind another blood cultist, banged on the ground, jumped high, then spun around and squatted in the air.

Gyeongcheon Daeseongmagon, Yu Seongrak.

And then, as if flying backwards, he leaps up, throws his head back, and faces the sky, unfolding the inverted Meteor Rock's cunning and rushing at the Blood Cultists.

Kwak-kwang, Qing lands roughly on my back, bounces twice, and gets up.

I tried using this as a countermeasure because Neungpa Mibo always appears with his back to the enemy, but, um, it's not easy.

And the waist of the blood cultist in that path is cut off at an angle and tilted.

The hot steam rising from the upper body and the hot contents inside meeting the cold air.

Thud! Thud! Boom! Indescribable roars echoed from behind.

Qing glanced over and saw a turtle-like thing lying face down with an iceberg on its back. Kim Heo-jung was lying face down with his upper body naked, revealing a blue, transparent iceberg on his back.

Oh, that was a lump of ice. Somehow, no matter how much I hit it, it didn't show any pain.

A battle in the other world that doesn't seem real, with strong winds and torrential rains and ice thorns rising up, wow, my heart is pounding...

"Prince Kim! Hold on a minute! I'll take care of these kids first!"

Qing screams.

The sight of the sword horse briefly casting a glance at him is met with a bang by a spinning ice turtle that flies in, taking advantage of the gap, and is blown away.

Yeah, you said you were my disciple, so you're worried?

The corners of Qing's mouth are torn all the way down to his ears.

Now the slaughter! Finally the slaughter!

"Just one!"

It's okay if your right arm is tattered.

Because the Qing originally enjoyed killing fairly, alternating between their right and left hands.

I didn't use the sword with my left hand, but then I wouldn't have to use the sword.

From the back of Qing's left hand, a huge, twisted white palm appears, and four blades extend out.

It seems that the Blood Cultist is trying to resist in his own way as he lifts up the pottery.

If it were a river crossing, it would be different, but with only pottery, and especially since the owner is a man, the evil thoughts born from a woman's resentment would become even more powerful.

"Now two!"

The Blood Cult's sword falls to the ground, cut into five pieces. Its owner, too.

Ah, this taste. It was hard because I kept squeezing it.

As they say, it's best to deal with beginners rather than experts.

A bright smile spreads across Qing's face.


CHAPTER 936

Four! Five! The numbers continue. Six!

It was such a cheerful and lively voice that anyone who heard it would think that she wasn't shouting out numbers, but rather playing nicely with a friend.

However, that shouldn't be the case.

The reason for shouting out the number of kills is to distract the swordsman even a little. If you just shout out the number in a flashy manner, how can you know if it's real or not?

So I have no choice but to show you the evidence.

"seven!"

Qing shouted, picked up the fallen limbs, and threw them with all his might towards the fiercely contested battlefield on the other side.

At first, I thought about cutting off the heads of the disciples of the martial arts master and throwing them at them, but since my right arm was still acting up, I was fighting with only my left arm, so cutting them off seemed like a hassle.

No, rather than being cumbersome.

The corners of Qing's mouth tremble slightly.

It was a murderous expression that seemed to be laughing with joy as the world's greatest killer finally slaughtered Ha-su.

If my friends saw me, they would either ask why I'm forcing a smile, or they'd question it to themselves.

There is no time to cut the neck.

Why would anyone turn down the opportunity to cut off the heads of villains just because it's a hassle? It would be so much fun and a truly ecstatic experience.

But, my internal energy, my internal energy is slowly falling behind.

How long has it been since my internal energy has been lagging behind?

So you have to laugh.

I don't know how tired I am, I'm completely excited, I'm completely energetic, and I can keep slaughtering you guys forever.

More cruelly, more viciously.

Qing's fingertips are firmly embedded in the blood cultist's stern face. The sensation of bones shattering, along with the warmth of life, envelops his hands.

Eight! Barak shouts, his heart plucked out and crushed as if to show off.

The firm, hard heart muscle was crushed and leaked out between my fingers, and for a moment, a dizzying, electric-like pleasure passed through me, but it was not the time to savor it.

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTNmk2eWowSkxDTlRLblpIOVl3akJ3RzdBdGpBV1NKY1dLZnRjejVZb2VCTQ

The enraged blood cultists rushed in.

Yeah, you guys should come.

There's not much time left to bet, and the new method consumes a lot of internal energy. It's better for the enemy to rush in rather than me.

It's the passing of three guys who occupy three directions.

Qing quickly sweeps through the enemies.

One sword, one pottery, one sword.

Deeng, using the Tathagata Shinjang to shoot Geomgang's knee, delays his arrival, then rushes at the guy with the sword energy in front and grabs his weapon with his left hand.

A sharp, sharp blade imbued with a sharp, dark energy, yet it dared not invade the indestructible, diamond-like power of the minority magicians who reached the Hwagyeong. He snapped the blade, which curved gracefully, and shattered the blade, then plunged it into his eye socket, forcing him to kneel.

The great sword sweeps over the place where Qing's neck was.

Qing, who had bounced back up, grabbed the blood sect swordsman by the collar and shoved him away while he was screaming and holding his eye socket.

The blood cultist who had raised his sword couldn't bring himself to kick out his comrade who had come forward, so he ended up embracing him.

Meanwhile, the sole of Qing's foot kicks the chin of the Blood Sect's disciple with a thumping kick.

A move like the picture, where the stepping foot and the raised foot form a straight line and draw an exact diagonal line.

Qing snatched the long sword from the swordsman who had risen up with his teeth flying, and threw it into the empty air on the other side.

A large fish or a large moonfish gets caught in the net that is flying in with its net spread out, and the weight swings.

The net, which had been torn apart in the air, fell helplessly to a distant place.

Nine! And a moment later, ten! Immediately after that, eleven! And half a beat later, twelve! And again.

The blood cultist lifts the Nangado.

The sword is bent back as far as it can go, and the waist is also bent like a bow, showing an honest stance of striking with all the strength of the entire body.

However, it is too slow.

No, the blue was too fast.

Fight! Black spores and celestial magic scatter beneath my feet. At that moment, Qing existed in two places simultaneously.

This refers to the phenomenon of an optical illusion in which an illusion appears to remain in its original location due to a sudden, rapid movement in an instant.

Qing's left hand stretches out.

The blackened hand gripped the blood cultist's shoulder!

The brutal thought of a black horse that destroys the body with an impact greater than the original, with the shoulder exploding immediately.

The blood cultist staggered towards him, and Qing immediately grabbed him by the collar and pulled him towards her. As if dancing a Western dance, Qing rushed towards him and hugged him tightly.

With his still trembling right arm, he wraps his arms around the blood cultist's neck, and with his left arm, he grabs the blood cultist's remaining arm and breaks it.

"Kwaaak!" Qing Barak shouts, leading the hostage, against the backdrop of a desperate scream.

"Stop! Do you want to see your comrades die?"

"Jeongtae!" "Let go of Jeongtae!" "You vile thing!"

"Kuuuuu, do you want to save this kid? Then put down your weapon for now."

The hostage taker, covered in blood, his eyes glowing with an ominous color, and the crowd of people who paused for the hostage and raised their knives.

Surprisingly, one of the two confronting each other is a swordsman of the Jeongpa faction, and the other is an evil blood cultist.

While the Blood Cultists were hesitating as they watched their comrades taken hostage.

The swordsman of the Jeongpa slits the neck of the hostage in front of him with a bitter smile.

"Cough!"

And the knight of the sect shouted.

"Do you want to see this kid die? Drop your weapon right now! Don't you think what I'm saying is true? Should I pluck out an eye, huh? I'll count to three and then drop your weapon."

The blood cultists exchanged anxious glances at the harsh threat, then nodded.

"I'll let it go! I'll let it go!"

And then we all slowly lowered our bodies and placed our weapons on the ground-

They all rush in at once, pretending to be there.

Of course, it wasn't particularly surprising.

As expected, they are blood cult seeds, merciless.

Blood cultists rushing in from all directions at once.

And finally, all kinds of weapons are wound around my master's true energy, and they are shot out as black energy and strong energy.

The first to arrive was Yuyeopdo, just before the river crossing.

As Qing's new form shoots out clones in all directions, the blood cultists who stayed behind in place of Qing, who had fled to Nungpamibo, are the only ones left, perhaps named Jeong-tae, or perhaps his surname is Jeong and his last name is Tae, and they are attacked by all kinds of herbivores shot out by their comrades.

Blood and flesh splattered everywhere, severed bodies, and beyond them, a clear, blue voice echoed. Thirteen!

However, Qing's smile was quite awkward.

Well, perhaps because they were disciples of the Sword Demon who were both martial arts masters and training enthusiasts, the power of those left behind was extraordinary.

Out of the twelve weapons, five are strong, one is truly dangerous, four are super-strong, and one is Hwagyeong?

Besides, the guys on the other side of the encirclement probably haven't even arrived yet, damn it, if only my right arm was still intact and my internal energy was still intact, I could probably rub it in somehow.

The bet is on unmanned stamina.

The original way to deal with a peerless master was to either bring in a peerless master of the same level, or to use up their internal energy by pouring out a large amount of force.

If your internal energy is completely depleted, how can you, no matter how skilled you are, have any other options? Your nerves are completely destroyed, and you're on the verge of being hit by a low-level sword.

Besides, Qing originally consumed a lot of stamina.

All the divine skills that have the power of transcending the fire realm require the internal energy of transcending the fire realm, and the Dokgogu Sword's Yeolhwapan consumes so much internal energy that it cannot be used even a few times.

Because the Neungpa Mibo method there also consumed a huge amount of internal energy.

Since Qing's dantian contained an energy that transcended the realm of fire, he could have fired indiscriminately without any problems, as long as it wasn't the Dokgogu Sword.

But if you don't have it, you have no choice but to fight by saving what you have.

The enemies rush in again.

Qing grits her teeth and runs out.

Ignore anything below the climax and just hit it with your body!

It's just a crack in the leather, so it'll get better if you apply saliva later.

Charge forward, blocking the two blades with your shoulder and back.

The expression of the super-stunned blood cultist, wide-eyed and bewildered, as if he didn't know he would get hit.

Fourteen! One of the Blood Cult members loses his life, and the blue screams loudly after the number.

"Ugh!"

But when a person is truly sick, they don't even scream, they just let out a desperate gasp.

Rather, the loud scream meant that it was bearable, what kind of bastard, what kind of bastard stabbed someone in the butt, and if he had missed even just a little bit, it could have been a disaster.

In an instant, a clear energy rushes into Qing.

Following that trajectory, there were five, no, six afterimages of the sword and the arm holding the sword. Although they were afterimages, they were clearly real, and they were the thoughts of the Baekryundo method.

Compared to the countless afterimages that overlapped like a single sword strike, it was a rather shabby sight, but comparing Hwa-gyeong's thoughts and Hyeon-gyeong's thoughts in the first place would have been a harsh task.

Qing twists her body desperately.

The afterimages that followed the precarious passing of Park Do in front of my chest,

Suddenly, a bang! Qing's vision was filled with white.

A blow that hits the lower jaw just below the ear, causing the head to spin and the skull to shake, causing a moment of dizziness and a loss of strength in the legs, causing the person to collapse.

Perhaps the only fortunate thing is that the vast majority of martial arts aren't designed to deal with enemies stuck to the ground.

Since they fell in the middle of a melee, it was difficult to immediately strike with weapons because their bodies were blocking each other, so the only thing they could do was to kick them urgently.

Qing curls up into a ball.

It was an unconscious response while my brain was shaking and I was out of my mind, and it was a reflex reaction that came from the experience of being beaten countless times in my first year as a martial artist.

A series of kicks flew towards the body of the blue creature, which was curled up like a pangolin, while covering its vital points, and at that moment, bang!

Someone's toe jabs into my right forearm. Ugh, this time, a painful gasp escapes me, and tears well up in my eyes in an instant.

At that moment, a loud scream rang out.

"You idiots! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! You're just getting in the way!"

At that shout, Qing also came to his senses.

Between the feet that are suddenly retreating, the flashing energy of Park Do shines like a cold starlight.

Qing reaches out, grabs one of her ankles, and pulls hard. With a squelching sound, something hot and wet pours down onto Qing's body.

Without even feeling any discomfort, Qing flips over and rolls on the fallen leaves.

The technique called "Naryeotagon" is ridiculed as being as unsightly as a lazy donkey rolling on the ground, but who wouldn't roll when their life was at stake?

Rolling left, rolling left, rolling right, lifting the lower body up over the head, rolling backwards like a baby, one turn, two turns, stretching out, then left again, left, left, left.

Weapons struck the ground one after another, and fallen leaves and broken pieces of dirt flew up.

You might think that even a martial artist can't hit that, but even if I explain it again, martial arts never assumes an enemy rolling around on the ground.

The blue fist slammed into someone's instep.

The blackened fist is a characteristic of the Black Death Horse, and the owner of the crushed instep collapses, letting out a truly painful gasp.

Qing's left arm roughly sweeps the floor.

Huge, white, twisted fingers with sharp claws at the tips sweep across the ground.

Fingernails entering the right shin and exiting the left shin.

And then, he rushed towards the other shin located on the left side, and in an instant, the great sword that was stuck on the ground barely managed to block the small-scale demon's attack.

"The right to rule, the right to rule! Step back! The net! Bring the net!"

Jitangkwon, a general term for the martial art of fighting while crawling on the ground, was unknown to Qing. His right arm was completely weak, making it difficult to raise himself, so he simply rolled around with all his might.

But now that the enemy's legs were far away, Qing quickly got up, put both knees together, and bowed somewhere.

A few Blood Cultists rolling on the ground, a few shuffling through the fallen leaves as if searching for the nets they had thrown down before charging in, and some aiming their weapons.

Qing's right arm is trembling.

Since his right arm was twisted and had weak nerves, he felt an unusual pain in his forearm, which had been kicked properly.

Miss, this is not good… … .

That was the moment.

Kwung! Something huge falls in front of Qing, and a cold chill brushes against his skin.

It was Kim Heo-jung, a human turtle lying on all fours with an iceberg sticking out of his back.

Qing's expression brightens significantly.

Why would Kim Heo-jung appear here?

In the meantime, since we've defeated the Sword Demon and the Siksim Demon, wouldn't it be to help clean up the remaining remnants?

Oh my, I never thought I'd be so happy to see a cute guy like this! It's so nice to hear Qing's voice.

"Confucius! You have come to help!"

Kim Heo-jung answered him.

"No, we have to run. Get on quickly."

"No, what, running away? The sword horse is no match for you, and the food spirit horse is half dead, so even if you miss, you miss. You're an opponent that Confucius can't lose to. Why are you running away?"

"That guy, who was halfway through death, was attacked by strange monsters and eaten his heart, and then he suddenly went completely crazy and-"

-Gh ...

Kim Heo-jung's words were interrupted by a huge roar that shook the entire world.

It is something that contains a truly enormous history and tremendous energy.

Qing immediately clung to Kim Heo-jung's back, clinging to the iceberg.


CHAPTER 937

As soon as Qing boarded, a thick layer of ice rose up and froze around Qing, half-enveloping him.

Then, Kim Heo-jung jumps up on all fours.

Kim Heo-jung's appearance, flying with all four legs, no, two hands and two feet spread out in all directions, was truly like a frog, or rather, a toad.

Because the frog's skin was smooth, it didn't match the bumpy, rough outer skin of the chubby man.

The ride was truly filthy, no, a feeling of victory? A feeling of victory? A feeling of victory? A feeling of victory? A feeling of victory? A feeling of victory? A feeling of riding? There were six characters in the Chinese character for toad: toad island (蟾), toad nyeo (蜍), toad chuk (鼀), toad chu?, toad na (癩), toad ma (蟆). In any case, the ride was the worst, and Qing could barely hold on to his body that was about to fall with his left hand.

-Where are you running off to!!

Once again, the ear-piercing battle of Yukhapjeonseong.

"What the hell!? Why did that dying guy suddenly come back to life!? What did he do!?"

"I don't know! Some bastards take out their own hearts and feed them to you, but they swallow them without even chewing them, and then suddenly they start spewing out red energy!"

The blood demon and blood ogre took out their own hearts and even kindly fed them to me.

It was a sudden disaster that happened right before those damn Zhongyuan kids were about to be massacred. A powerful bullet that even the Black Tortoise's Ice Armor couldn't stop came rushing in, forcing them to flee.

Of course, the claim that he was on the verge of being killed was Kim Heo-jung's one-sided claim, and it was impossible to know whether he was just enduring the beatings or whether he was truly winning.

Kim Heo-jung keeps flying.

Even though it was in a strange posture with all four legs spread wide, its body shot forward at high speed, and it shot straight down, clinging to a tree trunk, and then shot again, hitting the ground, then the tree, then another tree, onto a rock, and then back to the tree.

Kim Heo-jung's leaps, drawing a Z sign from left to right and up and down, are truly three-dimensional maneuvers, worthy of the title.

However, it was a very harsh moment for Qing, who was riding on it and half-buried in the iceberg.

It's hot, and it's cold!

Even if it is a blue light that is not strong, it is difficult to remain unharmed after being buried in ice.

The small head that was sticking out was bright blue, and the long eyelashes were covered in white frost, like snowflakes.

But before I could even feel the immediate cold-

Whack! Crack! Bang! Crack! Kung!

The noise of destruction closing in from behind, the screams of the forest as trees break, shatter, and fall in all manner of ways.

A situation where you are hanging in a direction facing backwards, with huge earthen pillars gradually approaching in your field of vision moving up, down, left, and right.

"Can't you go faster, faster!?"

"I'm doing my best!"

"No, when I fought with the swordsman, no, the swordsman kid, you chased me while breaking all the trees and rocks!"

"Are you talking about the first round!? I can't do it! Then you're saying I can't hold onto you!"

Qing-i, ah.

A spinning ice sphere that violently rolls its body, shattering anything in its path. If I had used it now to escape, I would have been able to escape faster.

In other words, it was Kim Heo-jung who came to pick her up when she could have just run away on her own.

Qing deeply reflected.

"Honey, you're surprisingly loyal. Sorry for calling you a toad. Hmm, let's call you a frog from now on. Frogs are pretty cute."

Kim Heo-jung is Bingwa, Bingwa from now on.

If Kim Heo-jung had known this, he would have asked if he could just call him Hyunmu.

Meanwhile, Pasak and Qing turn over the dirt.

The ground behind him flipped over and bounced back up, and something huge burst out through the pillar of dirt!

"What is that! Who is that!?"

"He's a heart-rending bastard!"

"What, why did you gain weight!?"

It clearly had a face, two arms, and two legs on its torso, but it did not look human at all.

A hideously swollen torso, with a large swollen head, but due to the body being so swollen, the lower part of the head is half buried in the body.

The limbs are also greatly swollen.

That's what happens when the symbol of the company that makes wheels on the homeland doubles in size.

It is literally a huge lump of flesh.

Moreover, the flesh seemed to be made entirely of fat, rippling and flying around so fiercely. If it contained all the true energy, then just how much energy must it contain?

Even when Kim Heo-jung gathered the energy of heaven and earth, it wasn't like that, it was like a huge landslide made up of human energy was coming.

Qing understood Kim Heo-jung's escape.

How can you not run away after seeing something like that?

A fat monster, a super super super super obese monster!

Of course, Kim Heo-jung may feel wronged. Even though it's understandable that he would run away.

The Four Directions martial art draws upon and manipulates the energy of nature. If a person's true energy consumes the four directions and expels the natural energy, wouldn't it be natural that their power would be unleashed?

Of course, a person's true energy cannot be so great that it can drive out the natural spirit.

And that actually happened.

In that moment, Qing realized her eyes had met. Even though her eye sockets were tiny, barely the size of a buttonhole, thanks to the fat surrounding them, she somehow knew they had met.

-You little rat bastards! I'll grind them up and drink them up!!

Woohoo, the food spirit that rises and flies straight up.

It was a Shikshimma that soared toward the sky, emitting red energy from its two hands that had become watermelon-shaped due to being so fat, and its bare feet that had become old pumpkin-shaped due to being so fat.

Qing's expression was completely rotten. No, he's a steel man or something. It makes me miss my hometown for the first time in a long time. Is this something I'll see even in this ancient, primitive age?

Suddenly, a dark shadow falls over Qing's face.

A huge lump of flesh that blocks out the sun.

And then, he rushes forward with his head forward-

"Come on!!! Get out!!! Go left!!!"

"I've already done my best-"

Boom! In an instant, the whole world is covered in dirt, gravel, tree roots, and so on.

The rising pillar of earth swallowed up Kim Heo-jung and Qing, but that was only for a moment.

Kim Heo-jung, with his limbs outstretched, spins around as if doing a side spin and soars high into the sky.

"Eww!!!" "Kkiyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"

A duet of high and low screams.

The world of Qing is spinning round and round.

The sky, the horizon that had fallen diagonally, the forest that had been shattered, the horizon again, and the sky again, the horizon that had fallen diagonally again, and the monster that floated above the shattered forest and stared at it.

Soon, a huge volleyball the size of a calf appears.

"It's coming! The wind! The wind! The wind!"

Qing, who was getting anxious, quickly stomped his left foot on his back.

The blue one was hanging on the iceberg on Kim Heo-jung's back, facing backwards, and its back kick repeatedly hit the back of Kim Heo-jung's head.

It must be very upsetting, but there is no time to feel hurt because the situation is dire right now.

In an instant, crunch crunch… …! With the sound of ice freezing heard from all directions, a thick ice wall suddenly rose up, encircling Qing and Kim Heo-jung.

And, what a mess!!

An ice wall that breaks apart in an instant.

Fortunately, the ice wall that collided with Kangtan pushed Kim Heo-jung's body away, so it was the moment when the combination of the world's ugliest man and the world's most beautiful woman succeeded in putting some distance between themselves again.

But, until when?

Qing swallows dry saliva.

Maybe the food cravings won't last long.

No matter how special the Blood Cult's magic was, there was a limit to the amount of energy a person could hold.

Since his whole body is swollen like that, the energy and blood vessels throughout his body must be broken.

In other words, it could be the final desperate attempt of a demon who is ready to die, burning his life.

But what if not?

Would the Great Demon of the Blood Cult sacrifice his life to slay his enemies? Those terrible creatures, for whom his life is the most precious thing in the world?

Or maybe there's some way to look forward to the future even after being completely bruised, and maybe he still believes in the swordsman who hasn't caught up to him yet.

Qing gritted his teeth.

"Confucius, please leave me alone."

"Huh!? What do you mean?"

"Let it go! You can run away on your own!"

Since there is a sword horse, if you run in the opposite direction and meet it, you will somehow be able to save your life.

As long as you're alive, there's bound to be a way, whether it's a weapon window or a status window.

Kim Heo-jung remains silent about it.

And then, oh my, the ice had frozen solid, and the blue that had been half-buried in the iceberg was now only showing its head.

"That's enough! If I live, I'll just grow old and die alone anyway!"

"Lady! Let go."

Although Qing was dreaming, his internal energy was already at a standstill, his right arm was in tatters, and the ice prison that had bound his entire body was unmoving.

"Let go! It's cold! I'm freezing to death!!"

"Haha, isn't it cool this time!?"

This kid is always so ugly, but why does he act cool only at times like this? I feel sorry for him.

No, and what the hell are two of these terrifying monsters? Does that make sense? Is this place some kind of blood cult den? Why are all these monsters gathered here?

It's all that Seol Ga-nom's fault. He gave me such ridiculous false information that I shouldn't have come to Baekdu Mountain.

Yes. From the beginning, you shouldn't have come to Baekdu Mountain.

Why did you come to Baekdu Mountain in the first place?

To find the ten greatest magicians in the world, the bloodthirsty demon master of the Heavenly Heaven, and the bloodthirsty demon master of the Heavenly Heaven.

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTMW5STGVmUVQxQ0pJN01vTDUyQUI0TEZqeDhzRjhSQk1TNVhqR3lyWkdBMg

Before that, before that.

Why did they look for the reverse blood magic in Baekdu Mountain?

Well, that's because it's efficient.

The skill exchange was a system that allowed you to choose and learn a martial art of your choice when your skill reached a certain level.

The first point reached was 500 points, the Buddha's body.

One thousand points are Sosu Magic, one thousand five hundred are Daejeong Seongong, two thousand are Yeokgeun Seusugyeong, three thousand are Jewang Geomhyeong, and four thousand are Bingbaek Shingong.

Five hundred, one thousand, one thousand five hundred, two thousand points.

Four times in units of 500 points up to here.

I changed it twice in units of three thousand, four thousand, and one thousand points, and the next required points are five thousand points.

But, the point required for the next karma exchange is currently unknown as to when and how much it will rise.

The previous time I was worried, my good karma was around the latter half of seven thousand points, so if I keep going up by one thousand points, I can change three of them from five thousand, six thousand, and seven thousand.

But if the required prerequisites jump out even once in the middle, just change two and that's it.

What if I change it without thinking, but I can only exchange up to two, so what if one is missing?

But where can I get the remaining three magics? What if I change them in advance and then they appear out of nowhere?

That would be a huge loss. It would be like blowing a chance to change anything.

For example, if you exchanged the Angcheonsal and Banshinjanggeopdo and learned them, what if Angcheonsal appeared somewhere?

It's such a shame to just throw away a precious exchange opportunity.

Yeah, that was the problem.

What a waste! Do you have to be strong all the time, even while feeling sorry for yourself?

Qing-i gritted his teeth.

I always think about how I need to become stronger quickly because I'm desperate, but when it comes to how to become stronger, all I think about is efficiency and loss?

Was that the attitude of a desperate person?

I should have changed it a long time ago.

If I could exchange three times, I would have finished the mission a long time ago and learned Bukmyeongsingong or something.

Even if that didn't work and it only happened twice, then all I had to do was beat the demons and fill up my karma.

I'll save it. I pretend to be desperate and in a hurry, but in the end, I feel bad about it.

In the end, I came all the way to this remote countryside, and was chased by blood cult kids, not to mention martial arts, and ended up receiving help from a guy I secretly thought was ugly-

"My lady! Come to think of it, it's so unfair to die without even having sex with a woman! I'm sorry, but can I just let you go now? Go to Giru! Even if it's just to regret all the practice you've put in! It's a thing I'm proud of, so I should try it at least once!!"

"Hey! Man! Seriously! I can't think of anything!"

Gratitude suddenly flooded in.

Seriously, seriously, ugly, ugly guy… … .

"Just hold on a little longer! Think about it, there's one last thing I'll do!"

"Hurry up! But why have you been speaking informally to me since earlier-"

"No! Just a little!"

Kim Heo-jung shut his mouth tightly.

Qing only calls him when he needs something, and he always hates and harasses him.

As of now, the current status is 8,511.

When he started out, he was in the latter half of his seven-thousandth year, but after defeating the corrupt officials of Joseon and the disciples of Geomma, he seems to have entered the eight-thousandth year.

But what else can I do now that I'm here?

Even if it doesn't work out, if you learn the Pacheon Station Blood Stream Heart Attack, you will be able to replenish your internal energy.

Because it was said that the reverse blood magic could reverse internal energy and produce incredible destructive power.

If it's going to be a problem, I can send the ugly guy away to get some sympathy before he dies, and I can try to escape on my own.

Qing uses the exchange window with his will.

Five thousand points exchange, Pacheon Station blood transfusion heart injection.

Please, next time, six thousand points, six thousand points!

But the rising need is six thousand five hundred.

Qing immediately chose Angcheonsal.

And then, the next requirement is:

A bright smile spread across Qing's face.

Necessary precepts. Eight thousand points. I believed in you! Martial arts window, I never disbelieved in you! Just thinking about you makes me smile!

Truly, you are the only one I have! My light! My salt! My soulmate, my soulmate!

If Mu-gong-chang had any ego, he would have been a very pathetic and self-destructive person, but anyway.

And finally, the half-body scar, exchange.

Next, Qing brings up the achievements of the newly learned magicians through the countless training points accumulated over time.

An unprecedented moment in martial arts history, where all ten of the greatest martial artists in the world gather in one place!

It would not be an exaggeration to say that this is the moment when the greatest of all mines, the Great Mine, is born!

Hemp Seomun-Qing!

and-

Suddenly, the sky reflected in Qing's eyes is clear.

Crush, rustle, somehow, the sound of waves crashing.

The unique feeling of floating on the water, lying down with no strength left, the flow of some kind of ocean current that touches your whole body.

The blue was floating on the sea.

Just, in such a peaceful sea.


CHAPTER 938

The blue body sinks downwards.

The sky seen from below is so blue and shimmering that even as I look at it, I feel a pang of sadness and find myself reaching out without thinking.

But the sky is getting farther and farther away, between the long, white, pitiful fingers, there, in the sky that is gradually getting darker, I am sinking.

Endless immersion.

How much time has passed like that?

A day, two days, maybe a hundred years, a thousand years, or even longer, or even longer, an endless eternity, just sinking into the infinite abyss.

Suddenly, in Qing's sight, touch, hearing, and all the senses he sees, hears, and feels, letters, voices, and some stern will seem to be engraved.

North Korean name Yu-eo, name Wi-gon.

There is a fish in the dark northern sea, its name is Gon.

This is the chapter on the soyoyoo of Jangja.

When Gon, who lives in Bukmyeong, becomes a great bird and spreads his wings, his wings cover the entire sky, and when the sea moves, he ascends to Nammyeong, that is, to the sky.

What kind of place is this North Myung?

The ancient man Hyegang said, "It is a meaning that is so distant that it has no end." The Liang Dynasty's Ganwen Emperor said, "It is so distant that it has no end."

The deep sea is so vast that it appears to human eyes as nothing but black, the end point of all waters that flow endlessly downward.

The North is the deepest part of the abyss.

-But is that really true?

The beautiful woman who had been slowly sinking into sleep slowly opens her eyes.

Even in the dark water, or rather, because it is dark, it shines even more whitely, with a sorrowful beauty that seems to not exist in this world.

The long, fluttering hair sways calmly, creating a truly still and mysterious atmosphere, as if it were emanating the elegance of something unmoving.

----

The pupils were turned over in wide-open eyes, so the bottom of the pupils were barely visible under the upper eyelids, with the whites of the eyes full.

Foaming at the mouth, his head shook violently, and he jerked left and right as if his neck was about to break, spraying the foam and saliva everywhere, and his hair flew up in a mess.

This was the horrific expression on the face of someone who had been exposed to brainwashing education, to the horrific sensation of their brain being violently crushed, like it was being crushed.

"Ugh, ugh, ahhh……!"

The rough moans of the woman with that miserable expression, as if she was holding back by forcing her mouth shut, but still, some emotion that was surging and could not be resisted was somehow surging out.

If you wrack your brain, you will be unable to help but spit out unbearable strangeness in unspeakable sounds.

"Ah! My lady! Let's go now! Let's go our separate ways! My lady!? Can you hear me!?"

"Ugh, ugh, ah, ugh, huuuuu……"

"Young lady!? Seriously! At this rate, ugh!"

Kwakwang! A pillar of dirt shoots up, and Kim Heo-jung is once again thrown far away like a watermill spinning rapidly.

"Kwaaaaak!!!"

Kim Heo-jung flew again.

----

The body of the blue rises.

After a brief moment, or perhaps a long eternity, the sight of a spotless, blue sky reflected across the shimmering waters is reflected in Qing's eyes.

Finally, quietly, Qing floats to the surface.

But this rise did not stop, and Qing's body began to flip over and rise.

It was a truly dull ascension.

Beautiful hair fluttering quietly like waterweed.

This would be most accurately expressed as sinking toward the sky.

The blue is sinking towards the sky.

Towards that endless sky, endlessly.

The land is a pitch-black sea, but as the sky sinks and the field of vision expands, a huge landmass is suddenly visible to the south.

And further and further away, the world's edge curved in a warm curve like a woman's breast, until at last the world was formed into a circle.

In an instant, the blue's gradual descent towards the endless sky at the end of the sky stops.

From up high in the sky.

----

High in the sky, Kim Heo-jung was spinning and flying, and his eyes, which had been following his body around in circles, suddenly came into sharp focus.

Below is the figure of a villain with both arms outstretched.

Because a surprisingly ugly lump of flesh was pointing its two hands together at him.

The evil winds have already been experienced many times.

Although its power is strong, it can be blocked with the Ice Crystal Black Tortoise Armor.

Anyway, since the Ice Black Tortoise Armor is a side effect of learning the Black Tortoise attribute, even if it breaks, it will be restored quickly, so it would be fine if you hit it with your back.

Kim Heo-jung gritted his teeth.

At the same time, it turns its body, turns its unusually long neck in large circles back and forth, and wiggles its hands and feet.

It's a dance that seems to imitate a turtle that has become excited, and at the same time, it's a really ugly and sloppy dance.

But even the result wasn't ugly and sloppy. A thick layer of ice began to cover Kim Heo-jung's limbs.

And then bang!

A blood-red ray of light stretched from the ground and struck Kim Heo-jung.

Bang! A bloody explosion and a whirling wind sound like the screams of a vengeful spirit.

Soon, Kim Heo-jung fell down like a bird without wings.

Thump! A dull noise.

Kim Heo-jung, with his limbs outstretched, is torn and broken and falls into the chaos of the forest.

In the meantime, a voice is heard in my ear.

"Ugh……"

"My lady?! Are you alright?! Oh, this is shocking-"

-Hahahaha!! Gotcha!! You piece of trash!!

Kim Heo-jung immediately jumps at the annoying voice that is digging into his ears.

But in that moment, a dizzying pain hit my leg.

In the meantime, Kim Heo-jung was floating awkwardly in the air, and a bright red Kang-tan appeared next to him.

Bang! A blast of red energy flutters, and Kim Heo-jung bounces and slips three times, then bang! He's blocked by a tree stump and falls down with a thud.

Kim Heo-jung swallows the blood that is rising up, but then suddenly, he coughs out, repeatedly squeezing his lungs.

Thanks to that, the blood I was trying to swallow was all over my mouth, and it was even flowing back up my nose.

A fleshy monster tumbles down in front of him and stands on the ground.

-Kuhehe, you ugly bastard, no, I can't even describe you with the word ugly, you're really so ugly, no, that's not enough, even a trampled wall would be more handsome than you.

"Ugh……!"

Kim Heo-jung expressed his genuine anger.

Because I was truly angry.

Kim Heo-jung was also acutely aware of his own ugliness. He was clearly the world's ugliest man, yet he couldn't shake off his self-deprecation.

However, the way Shiksimma ran wild was a bit of a consolation to Kim Heo-jung.

This was a consolation for me, thinking that I was the ugliest man in the world, and that there was a kid uglier than me.

But since I heard him mock me for being ugly, I couldn't help but feel genuinely angry.

I wanted to yell at him loudly, saying that he looked like a rotten, swollen lump of meat covered in countless molds and that he was ugly.

Kim Heo-jung is in a state of complete despair because he doesn't have the courage to rebuke the person who is trying to grab his lifeline in the face of a life-threatening crisis.

How ugly! Kim Heo-jung!

Looking down at Kim Heo-jung like that, Siksimma bursts into a mean laugh.

-Hehe, do you have any last words?

Then Kim Heo-jung, with a determined expression, said, "Thud!"

I immediately got down on my knees.

"Please save me. Please."

How truly shameful! Kim Heo-jung!

----

At some point, the blue sky begins to fall. Blue sky pours down, blue sky scatters, and an infinite number of blue sky clouds fall toward the land and seas of the world.

The blue that rises from the sea falls into the sea.

Some blue jumps into the river in pouring streams, some settles gently on the bright petals of the green leaves like a fluttering spray, and some falls onto the ground and seeps in, down and down again.

So the blue flows.

The blue that falls into the sea is already the sea, and the river flows and reaches the sea.

When the grass and flower petals look up at the sky and shed tears, the green turns into dew and rolls down the leaves and seeps into the earth.

The blue waters that have permeated the earth thus conform to the great currents of the earth, and some of these currents rise to the surface and become springs and rivers, or become the heat that rises from the surface of the deep sea.

Eventually, the sea turns around the world and returns to the sea.

Because in the end, everything is one.

The North is the sea, and the sea is everything.

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTMW5STGVmUVQxQ0pJN01vTDUyQUI0SktDTDR1WXBIR2VpbFpKZVVRNjFmNg

In an instant, the world disappears.

As if it were an illusion, like a mirage.

So, in the darkness where there is nothing, in the void where nothing exists.

But Qing feels its presence.

That which is invisible does not mean that it does not exist, above and below, left and right, front and back, the whole world and the entire universe are filled with distinct energy.

The sea of energy, the vast flow in which all energy circulates from the unit to the infinite individual, and from the infinite individual to the unit, the sea of energy!

So.

This is called Bukmyeong (North Darkness).

----

Even Shiksimma couldn't have anticipated this level of ugliness, as the furrow at the corner of his mouth appeared to be slightly parted.

"Ugh, ugh……! What the……."

And what is this absurd sound that continues from time to time!

-That girl, what, have you lost your mind already? No way! I was going to boil her in the water I personally cut off and roll her in salt!

Kim Heo-jung's liver suddenly became cold.

You're a truly mad monster, killing people. How could you dare say such horrible things when you were born as a human?

What a cruel and horrible thing to say!

You must never disobey!

The conclusion was quite ugly, but everyone's life is precious, and no one wants to be like a vegetable that has been blanched and salted.

"Ugh, hehe, sir? Can I leave this bitch here?"

-Ha, what a funny guy. You used to cherish him so much, and now you're going to let him go?

"Well, I think this is enough loyalty. Come to think of it, what loyalty is there? No, what loyalty is there? I guess I was just momentarily out of my mind. What on earth am I connected to with this rude woman? Hmm, why would I do that?"

-Ha, are you asking me that?

"No, why did you do that? You could have just left, but you had to endure this..."

Kim Heo-jung forgets his cowardice and becomes lost in thought.

Why? Why did you come back?

Well, first of all, Lady Ximen is pretty.

But being pretty isn't everything.

Lady Seomun, your breasts are huge! They're so huge!

There are many women in the world with big breasts, but a woman with only big breasts is rare, and on top of that, a woman with a beautiful appearance?

Wouldn't it be more surprising that such a woman actually existed?

But more than that, more than anything, those eyes.

Because of the cold gaze of the woman, or rather, the gaze that looked at him without distinction between woman and man, a gaze that was not filled with contempt, as if looking at dirty filth.

The same was true for Lady Gongryang, but her gaze was somehow filled with a cold indifference, as if she was looking at something that had nothing to do with me.

But Lady Ximen was not like that, her gaze was so clear as she looked at people, it had been so long since she had seen her.

Of course, it wasn't always clear, and sometimes I looked down at it with contempt, as if I was pathetic, but it gave me a feeling that I couldn't quite put into words. I don't know what it was, but at least it wasn't a negative feeling like unpleasantness.

Besides, when on earth was the last time you heard an apology?

Even though he helped people, he was slapped in the face because of his appearance and chased by innocent civilians with weapons, and among them, there was not a single person who sincerely apologized without being beaten.

An apology is something that people do to each other.

I've never received a proper apology before, so I've never been treated like a human being.

"Ugh, ugh, ugh……"

Suddenly, Kim Heo-jung came to his senses at the sound of Qing's strange and somehow eerie voice that made him come to his senses.

Did you really say, "Just hold on, just hold on for a moment?"

I said there was a way, so let's try to buy some time, somehow.

"Is this bitch really out of her mind? Well, maybe throwing her in a pot might bring her back to her senses. Put that bitch down and get lost. She's so ugly that it's dirty to even touch her. Consider her survival thanks to her ugly face, worse than a bug's, and at least hold a memorial service for her parents who passed down that vicious appearance to her. Hehehe.

The food demon then mocks and waves his hand.

Kim Heo-jung then let out a laugh like a villain.

"Your Majesty, I am truly grateful for such a kindness. Your Majesty, you have bestowed such great grace upon me. I am truly the Emperor!"

-Huh? Keuhehe, even your crooked eye sockets have proper eyes.

"I would like to show you a little bit of my talent by dancing, as a token of my gratitude for Your Majesty's grace. However, this dance itself is a dance of gratitude, moved by Your Majesty's great grace."

-Huh? Really? That sounds fun. Show off your wit.

Then, Kim Heo-jung turns his head up and down strangely, and his long neck makes it even more strange.

Spread both arms wide and swing them up and down, then quickly open and close only your knees while keeping both feet on the ground.

It was a dance move so ugly that I couldn't even laugh, and instead wanted to turn my head away.

Hyunmu-mu, the form of a black tortoise swimming in the ocean.

Shikshimma was shocked.

-What the heck! What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? I don't want to see you, so stop! Stop!

"Wait! Just look at me for a moment! Please acknowledge my heart, this gratitude!"

-What are you looking at, ugh, I hate to see you! Nooooo!!! How dare you mock me! You refuse the drink I gave you and drink the punishment drink instead!

"Wait! Just a moment! I'm expressing Nari's grace with my whole body!"

-Shut up! I'll kill you!

Such a horrible dance move.

The moment Shiksimma becomes enraged and immediately draws up the blood that is overflowing in his body-

"You go after me!"

Suddenly, a human figure soared above Kim Heo-jung's head, swooping down like a swift falcon!

Before I knew it, a bright smile filled her face, and her proud smile was truly a dazzling beauty.

To Siksimma, it's just a hateful face.

-You bitch!

The two men reach out their hands.

The rippling flesh surges towards Shiksimma's right hand, causing his right arm to swell to the point where its length and thickness are equal.

And so, the hands of Qing and Siksimma touch.

Strangely enough, there was no sound, and only the rippling of Shikimma's skin hinted at the rather violent encounter.

and.

Nothing happened.

There was no grand clash of flags, no violent explosions, and certainly no decisive moment of battle where the losers and the winners would be divided.

Just stand there, hand in hand, facing each other, and be still.

But the expressions on their faces are truly different.

Shiksimma's expression was one of shock and utter confusion, while Qing's expression was one of a bright smile with his incredibly white teeth shining.

Soon, Qing turned to Kim Heo-jung.

"Hey, Mr. Kim, what are you doing? This kid can't do anything anymore."

Then Qing shouts in an excited voice.

"So, get out of here!!"


CHAPTER 939

Hehehe… …. A dry, crackling laugh resonates like dirt.

It sounded like it would crumble to pieces if touched.

It's vain and dry, so at least this laughter isn't laughter.

Well, the world was a mess after all.

Below, the dry, cracked earth is exposed, and above, the sun blazes with its persistent heat. There has never been a drought so severe as this one.

So, what is the appearance of beings under the sun?

Those who wear tattered rags have sunken cheeks and are thin.

He was as thin as his body, and he was so exhausted that he just lay there like a corpse, gasping for breath.

Hehehe… … .

Again, a hollow laughter rings out.

Those who were slumped over him glared at him with angry expressions, but that was only for a moment.

Even that is tiring and difficult, so I just give him a fierce look and then slump down again, just breathing in this dry drought… … .

Among them, one woman looks up at the bright sun with longing eyes.

I wonder what the woman's feelings are like.

In this terrible drought, is it because I long for the bright sun, and pray that it will disappear quickly?

Of course, that was absolutely not the case.

Because then something really big would happen.

The true nature of the bright, blazing sun is the original essence, or in other words, the innate vitality of a person.

If the source of the spirit disappears, the person dies. No matter how severe the drought is due to the exhaustion of the dantian's energy, who would dare to covet the source of life, the spirit of the spirit?

Rather, if they try to drag out the expedition, everyone will have to rise up together and desperately try to stop it.

Yes, this is my image in the Qing dantian!

The little blue ones, the blue spirits are currently completely dried up, because they have almost used up their bet.

Their once chubby cheeks were sunken and shadowed. The clothes they wore, each with their own distinctive features, were in a shabby state, with visible marks of tattered stitching.

Both eyes were in the shape of the letter 乂 and were lying face down on the dry floor of the lower abdomen.

Hehehe… … .

In this situation, the excited Pacheonmagi keeps bursting out in laughter.

It's a hollow laugh, as dry as sand, but Pacheonmagi's voice has always been like that, so if you listen closely, you can hear that he's quite excited.

Normally, they would have met with appropriate punishment, but now that they are so powerless, they just listen with one ear and let it go out the other, saying, "Okay, you laugh, we need to rest..."

That was the moment.

Clothes, oh oh? A surprised sound.

The little ones lying on the floor turned their heads, and on the other side, there was a Shiksim Magi wearing a heart-patterned rag?

Flesh begins to rise on Shiksimmagi's sunken cheeks, oiliness builds up on his flabby skin, the stitch marks on his clothes disappear, and dirt begins to fall from his fabric.

Not only that, he would jump up and emit a bright red energy from his entire body.

Aaaah, a tremendous power surges forth! Shiksimmagi shouts with boiling power.

As the leader of the orthodox martial arts school, the shaman of the Taoist school, who felt uneasy about the vibrations of the demonic energy, turned his head and looked at the Wolnyeojingi, who had a very serious expression on her face. Wolnyeojingi, what on earth is that…?

To which Wolnyeojin-gi furrowed her eyebrows and answered, "I don't know… … , what is that? It's scary… … .

On the contrary, the Magi, despite their gaunt faces, show a weak and difficult smile.

Great, Seomunshiksimmagi. Destroy the Taoist and Buddhist truth with your own hands. You can do it now.

At that moment, a surge of magical energy suddenly rose from the entire body of the Shiksim Magi, splitting into many from the high place and rushing towards all the true energies.

That evil magic is showing its true colors!

The Qing Dynasty's Taoist daggers are a real threat!

Why us too? You bitch, this is straight up betrayal!

The Blue Magic Chocomis are also in great danger together!

And so, a terrifying ray of light extended from the Shiksim Magi and struck the Jin-gis.

in result.

Jinki is healthy!

… … ?… … ??… … ??? What is it? What the heck is it??

The Jin-gis, who had become normal, stood up with dumbfounded expressions and clenched and unclenched their fists, as if wondering what was going on.

Well, something that couldn't happen happened.

The nature of energy is such that the prosperous ones devour the declining ones.

Although there is a relationship of compatibility between Jin-gi represented by Fire, Water, Wood, Friday, and Saturday, if the difference in size is overwhelming, the one who is excited will just take everything.

For example, wood is strong against water and weak against fire, but if you hold a match in front of a large tree, the fire will just go out.

But what is going on?

The evil energy of the strong and powerful Shiksim Demon King touched each Jin-gi, suddenly changing their properties. Wouldn't they fill that emptiness with their own familiar selves?

Wouldn't it be like setting fire to a tree and having the embers turn into bark and stick to it?

What an unbelievable miracle!

And whoosh… …!

With the sound of countless waves crashing, moisture suddenly rises from the dry, cracked floor of the danjeon, wetting the floor.

From now on, this is the beach, and the unusually black water has risen to one side of my dantian.

Hwanhee Jinki, who was always distracted and couldn't sit still, suddenly jumped in and splashed around in the water, swimming wildly and jumping around excitedly.

But more than that.

In that moment, all the Jin-gis' heads turned at once.

At the end of everyone's gaze, there was the figure of Pacheonmagi, who had his mouth tightly shut.

Dori dori? Dori dori. Dori dori? Nod nod.

After a while, Pacheonmagi slowly lowers the hand that was covering his mouth.

And then, before you know it, big water droplets are hanging from his big eyes, and he speaks as if he has given up.

Hehehe… … . Hehehehe… … .

The Pacheonmagi is smiling.

----

If I were to describe in one word what Shiksimma felt the moment his hands and his mouth met, it would be this.

Push… … .

This is an onomatopoeia that expresses the appearance of something strong crumbling and losing its strength. This is precisely the state of the magic energy that had gathered and seethed in the palm of Shikshimma's hand.

The changes didn't stop there.

The energy is flowing out through the contacting long bones, so no matter how hard you try to control it, it won't listen to you.

It is impossible to go against the flow of energy from the dantian to the right hand.

I don't know the cause, but I know the culprit.

Well, the daughter's enemy, who had been holding her right hand, was so excited that he split his lips horizontally with a bright face.

And suddenly, the name of a certain martial artist whose true identity has not been confirmed, such as a legend, folk tale, ghost story, rumor, suspicion, etc., flashed through Shiksimma's mind.

A magical technique that absorbs the opponent's true energy, and when the true energy runs out, it even absorbs the enemy's true energy and sucks it out.

The magic of absorbing essence, this is called Absorption Essence.

It is called the most terrible of all terrible things, the most evil, the most vicious, the most evil magic of all time.

"……Take control!!"

At the sound of a confident voice, Shiksimma suddenly came to his senses and shouted.

"Absorbing magic!"

It was a scream, like a scream.

Well, since my internal energy just flows in without any movement, I can only shout out things like the Six Combat Battles without any effort.

His eyebrows arched at a steep angle.

"It's not a magic absorption technique, is it?"

"Don't be ridiculous! Is there another magic besides the magic of absorbing the essence of the opponent, the very essence of vitality? You bitch, you're planning to take my essence! You're planning to drain my vitality!"

The expression on his face was very rotten.

No, why do you say it like that?

Instead of using terms like "betting" or "jin-gi," why are they suddenly using terms like "jeong" or "jeongryuk," which are only used in the fundamentals of Taoism?

"You bitch, you pretended to run away when I was at my peak, didn't you? To take my heart, to take all of my heart! That bastard was right! You weren't a demon in harmony, but a demon in possession, and among them, a great demon! You were a cursed great demon addicted to sexual pleasure!"

As Qing's foot shot out, unable to bear it any longer, Shikshimma's knees immediately gave way and he snapped his knees!

Since his knees were also fat, it was not a thud but a clap, and the sound of the flesh being hit by Qing's right foot repeatedly hitting Shikshimma with the top of his right foot was a clank clank.

However, it didn't seem to cause much damage other than the screams of "Ah, aah" as if the energy filled under the flesh was acting as a buffer.

However, the use of true energy was also blocked, and the fact that both the person absorbing it and the target being absorbed could not use their internal energy was a characteristic of Bukmyeongsingong.

No, but why can't I use my internal energy?

What kind of ultimate martial arts is this?

It's not ultimate at all.

The Bukmyeongsingong can be very unfair.

In a one-on-one fight, it's an absurd martial art that guarantees victory just by raising a hand, and it's a truly unprecedented and fraudulent art, so what more could you possibly ask for?

"No. Mr. Kim! What are you doing? I said George!"

Qing turns her head and screams.

There was Kim Heo-jung standing there, awkwardly.

"No, what is it? Why are you watching?"

Kim Heo-jung gives a hesitant answer with a red face.

"Uh, um. Since you're having sex, I was worried I might be bothering you. Don't worry about it, just continue. I didn't realize you were a woman who takes men's pleasure, but I won't bother you."

Since the title suddenly changed from "Lady" to "Your Majesty," it seems like the mental distance has widened.

"No, what the hell are you talking about? I said it was George."

"Oh, weren't you taking a liking to me? Or maybe I'm watching, so I'll keep an eye on you secretly so you don't get distracted."

"No, I've held him back so he can't use his internal energy, so I have to deal with him now. Otherwise, he'd have to hold him back all day because he has so much internal energy."

"Ouch! You ugly bastard over there! This bitch, this bitch must be killed! This bitch is a sucker, a sucker! That damned sucker! Kill her now, Ouch! Stop! Stop! Stop hitting her!"

"Oh, you rascal! Although the Ximen warrior here used sexual intercourse as his weapon and must have seduced countless men, his wicked behavior doesn't deserve his death! You villain!"

"I told you this bitch is a sucker!!!"

"Huh, is that the nickname of the West Gate warrior? Did he do enough to deserve a nickname?"

Kim Heo-jung's Jungwon dialect is fluent because his hated master's son has been a Jungwon person for a long time.

However, since he lived in the mountains for fear of others seeing his training process, all of Kim Heo-jung's common knowledge about martial arts came from his teacher's stories about the Zhongyuan.

He was a master who did his best to pass on common sense to his disciple who would later complete the Four Directions and become the absolute ruler of the Zhongyuan.

I had roughly conveyed the information about the ten greatest magicians in the world and the murderous murders, but what was more worrying was that the disciple's eyes would blaze at the mere mention of the word "woman."

There are witches who extract men's emotions through sexual intercourse, so they are busy nagging men to be careful with women until their ears are tingled.

"No, I'm not a sucker! I feel sick, really!"

"Isn't that so? Is that really not the case!?"

"No! Absolutely not!"

"Isn't that true? Is it really true!?"

"I said no!"

"Aren't you willing to stake everything on it? Can you swear on Eternal Life, your own party, and your own master?"

Yeongjon is a word used to honor the other person's father, Jadang is a word used to honor the other person's mother, and Sajon is a word used to honor the other person's teacher.

In other words, is it true that Mom, Dad, and Master are betting on it?

"No! You brat! What are you doing without arguing? Things will get complicated when that black bastard comes!"

Kim Heo-jung suddenly came to his senses.

Now that I think about it, there was one more enemy.

So Kim Heo-jung extended his fist.

Black Tortoise Fist! A giant fist covered in ice burrows deep into Shiksimma's psyche.

However, the fist is wrapped in a soft, uncomfortable feeling, and there is no feeling of impact being transmitted at all.

Hyunju's fist is followed by a Hyunmu kick! Hyunmu ice shard launch! Hyunmu iceberg drop! Hyunmu ice thorn surge!

Qing also kicked and kicked and kicked and kicked again.

If my right arm was still intact, I would hit him, but that would be impossible, so I just keep kicking him with my superhuman strength.

"Ah! Oh! Stop! Aah! Aah! Aah!!"

The screams of a hungry horse being beaten up.

It was a truly horrific sight to see the torn waistband of the top, the torn pants, and the rippling flesh.

The sound of rice cakes hitting each other loudly resonates.

In the midst of such exciting beatings.

Shiksimma was feeling genuine fear.

Every time I got hit, my internal energy was drained away in chunks, so I couldn't control my internal energy, but it was probably being consumed as some kind of defensive nerve.

And the moment all that energy is consumed, the expedition will be slow and you will end up being squeezed like a dried fish.

No, that won't do! I, the great Subsimma Hwang, will die here!?

"Eww!!! Get off me! Let go! Let go! Let go of me! Let go of me!!!!!"

The food demon struggles desperately.

As he waved his right hand around, Qing's body was swept up in it and swung around.

No matter how much Qing's body transcends humanity and possesses the power of a warrior, the difference in weight between a woman's body and the general's body cannot be overcome.

His fingers dug between Shiksimmagun's fingers, or more precisely, into his flesh.

The difference in weight was unwinnable, but the strength was enough to withstand Qing's body.

Shikshimma swings his right arm and throws him to the ground.

Boom! Aah!

A painful scream erupted from Qing's mouth as he hit the ground hard. But he held on, applying strength to his already pure white hands, making them even more pale.

Shikshimma would swing his right arm in the opposite direction, bang! bang! Sometimes he'd swing at Kim Heo-jung, slam him to the ground, and spin around, struggling to get the blue off.

While constantly shouting for the sword with his mouth.

"Sword Demon! Sword Demon!! Where are you!! Oh my gosh!!! Save me! Save me!!! I'm dying! I'm dying!"

"Shut up! You're getting older and you're looking for your mom, ugh."

In an instant, Qing, who was swinging, fell on the spot where Qing's pelvis had landed, and soon, crunch!

Ugh. The pain is terrifying. My lungs are constricting, I can't breathe, and without realizing it, saliva is flowing out and tears are welling up.

But Qing's eyes, instead, burn with a very ominous color and a light that has never been seen before in the world.

Qing's body bounces.

He put his leg around Shiksimma's shoulder and tightened his grip, then put strength into his waist and pushed his upper body forward, causing Shiksimma's arms to tremble.

A terrible scream bursts out at the same time.

"AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!"

"Get behind! Get behind!!"

"Gaaaaaaah!!!!"

A bone-chilling scream. And-

Kwajik!

The elbow of the Siksimma was bent in a direction that the arm should not be bent in.

Qing doesn't stop there, he shakes the dangling Shiksimma's lower body violently to add weight.

"Kwaaaaaaaah!! Kwaaaaah!!!"

A desperate scream continues.

The pain of having my dislocated elbow roughly handled is difficult to describe in words.

The mind of the Siksimma was dyed pure white, reason flew away, and only a beast writhing in pain remained.

And then, sizzle!

The blue one flew across the sky.

He held his chubby hand, which was bent sharply in his left hand, and hugged his arm, which was only below the elbow, tightly.

"My lady!"

Before you know it, Kim Heo-jung, who has changed from a gentleman to a nobleman, jumps up and accepts the invitation.

"Ahhh! Arm! Arm! My arm!!"

The screams mixed with the cries of a hungry person.

It was a desperate situation, with blood gushing out and a screaming man clutching his missing arm.

Hey, Qing-i, my goodness, I'm so speechless.

Is this the time to be crying and making a fuss over the loss of just one arm? Even with the enemy right in front of you?

That bastard who eats other people's hearts is crying and snotting because one of his arms was blown away.

That kid is also a real punk, he really is a total punk and shits himself.

Of course, I'm grateful because I'm not very conscious.


CHAPTER 940

Qing stretches out his hind legs, pushing his knees forward with all his might. His forelegs are folded so that his calves and thighs touch, and his soles are pulled in at the ends.

The body leans forward, the folded legs spread out freely, and the Yongcheon point on the upper sole of the foot touches the ground, releasing tremendous internal energy.

Ouch! Pelvis!

Suddenly, a terrible pain surges from below my side, above my pelvis. It's excruciating, like being pounded by a giant, two-handed hammer.

Miss, when you hit the ground earlier, the sound was unusual. It looks like your bone is cracked… … .

But pain is nothing. My bones are strong, so I'll get better with a little spit. More importantly, I need to get that bastard out of bed before he comes to his senses.

In fact, when a bone is cracked, it causes more pain than when it is broken.

When your bones are cracked and tattered, tears well up in your eyes reflexively every time you shake them, so it's not a pain you can just ignore.

But the Qing held on.

This is probably the difference between a martial artist who has been trained through actual combat and one who has easily reached a level through elixirs.

The crucial difference between Shiksimma, who was in a state of panic after having his arm ripped off, and Cheonhwageom, who had endured extreme pain while crossing countless death lines.

Qing, who had rushed in again, grabbed Shikshimma's left hand, which was holding onto his torn elbow.

In order to suppress the true energy of Bukmyeongsingong, you can't just touch any place or make physical contact.

The master of the new technique must place the palm of the hand in contact with the enemy, and the main energy channel of the enemy must flow smoothly in a shallow location under the skin.

Of course, the conditions were not that difficult.

There should be one or two places where the main energy channels flow smoothly in shallow locations under the skin.

For example, the same long-sleeved heart, the Yongcheon and Josim of the soles of the feet, the Samyin Bridge located three inches above the inner peach pit, the Dantian located one span below the navel, the perineum in a very embarrassing location, and if it's a man, a large energy channel passes through the scrotum, and isn't the spine of the back itself a large passage of energy and blood, like the Imdokyang vessel?

And also, the internal acupoint on the inside of the wrist.

Qing, who had twisted his wrist, opened his own energy channel and then opened the enemy's energy channel, connecting the two.

There was no other method that Qing could use to absorb internal energy.

All water eventually flows to the sea, as all things in the world flow from higher to lower places.

And the Qing's Dantian was the lowest sea and deepest point in the world.

"Eek, let go, let go!"

"Hehehe, I can't let go!"

As expected, Ximen Qing was good at scaring people, he was a genius.

Now that his only arm has been grabbed, all he can do is swing his elbow and the only thing that touches him is hot, fragrant blood.

Then, Qing rebounds and flies his body, forcing Shiksimma's arms to extend, and wraps his legs around the enemy's shoulders to secure him firmly.

And then he gave it strength and trembled.

"Ahhh! Again! Ah, no! No!"

"Kkiyaaaak!! Okay! Kkuaaak!"

"Ahhhh!! I was wrong! I'm sorry!! Please, please!!"

"Hey! Don't move!!"

There's only one person with a broken arm, but there are two screams.

Well, since Shiksimma's body was jumping around like a shrimp out of water, and even though he was already feeling a pain like his pelvis was being sawed off from exerting himself, every time his body bounced, Qing's breath would stop, gasp, gasp.

Qing glares at Kim Heo-jung with eyes as fierce as an axe blade.

Why does this kid come here and throw clumsy punches like a black tortoise fist and a black tortoise kick when the table is already set?

"Hey, Mr. Kim, what are you doing? Come and help me. Freeze it, ugh, freeze it! It's a frozen ma-doo!"

"Well, first of all, I deal with water, not cold air. Besides, the study of the Black Tortoise is in the hands of the Black Tortoise Minister…"

"Tseuup, ah, what, I have to dance? Then I can just dance, ugh, seueueuup."

"Well, if you dance the North Pole Dance, it's not like you can't freeze, but then I think Lady Ximen won't be safe either."

These were the great weaknesses of the Four Directions.

Since martial arts combine with dance, one can dance and manipulate the energy of nature, but if this dance is not established, the energy of nature is useless and one must just use one's own true energy.

Due to the nature of martial arts, there are few skills that can be performed.

Besides, where does nature discriminate between people?

When it rains, we all get hit, just like some get hit and some don't.

Qing immediately realized this.

If the Four Directions were so great in the first place, would his successors have remained nameless and unknown?

To begin with, it is a martial art that is not suitable for a group because it sweeps a wide area without any pia, so I wonder if it was left as a one-man legend.

Come to think of it, I survived the entire brainwashing session because I was buried in ice, otherwise I would have definitely suffered full body frostbite…

"I don't know, miss, just shut up!"

"Yep! I'll do it!"

And so, thud thud thud thud thud ugh! ugh!

Clink Clink Clink Clink Clink Clink Kwak! Kwak!

Kook kook aaaahh ...

As Qing twisted her arm with great passion, she felt the tendons attached to her bones begin to tear off, one by one.

"Sword Demon!! Save me!! Save me!!"

Okay, there's not much left now-

That was the moment.

A chilling, alarm-like sensation, a presence heard behind me, a distant mass blocking the wind as observed by the Awakening Divine Art's atmospheric flow.

"Use it."

Qing releases his legs and quickly jumps up, flying across the street to the other side of the horse.

As Qing still held Shiksimma's wrist tightly, his round, fleshy body spun around halfway, crushing the torn elbow on the other side.

Kwaaak, the scream erupts again.

And then, boom! A spear plunged into the spot where Qing's shoulder had been, sending pebbles flying everywhere.

Sword Demon, appear!

Finally, Geomma opened his palm toward Kim Heo-jung. Normally, he would say, "Don't do that," but in this case, he would mean, "Let's talk."

So, Kim Heo-jung, who was preparing to do that hideous dance again by stretching his arms wide and craning his neck, stops for a moment with a suspicious expression.

Not letting go of the pose is the will to continue dancing again at any time.

Soon, amidst the screams of the demon, the black demon slowly approaches with both arms raised.

Qing also crouched down and looked up at Geomma, still holding Shikshimma's wrist and sucking up his internal energy.

"Hmm, what is this situation?"

"I'm trying to eat a meal."

Sword Demon! Sword Demon!! Save me! Please save me!! Please save me! You bastard! You fucking bastard!!

Even though Shiksimma was screaming loudly, the experts were able to continue their conversation without any problems even if someone shouted.

"No, I wasn't talking to you. Brother Yoo, stop joking around and get up. You called me so desperately, so I thought you had another plan. I wondered if you were setting up a trap to take my heart."

The swordsman was relaxed.

As if it were completely natural that Shikshimma was playing.

Well, that can't be helped.

According to the common sense of the swordsman, the Shikshimma, which had consumed countless blood essences and reached a state of blood rage, was a powerful being that even he could not dare to confront.

What can be done even if Cheonhwageom is skilled and Kim Heo-jung's martial arts skills are amazing?

Considering the defensive power of Bloodlust, it won't be defeated even if you just stand still.

So, considering Simsimma's usual annoying and mean nature, it's clear that he's pretending to be cornered and trying to turn things around and make people despair.

It was a dizzying experience.

I was screaming for help, but the guy who showed up leisurely was just calm and asked why I was doing that.

"Bastard, help me, save me, this bitch, this bitch is huffing- ugh!"

Qing quickly put his right hand into Shiksimma's mouth.

Judging by the attitude of the swordsman, it seems that he thinks that the Siksimma is being treated well, but if he hears that it is a magic absorption technique, he will immediately understand the situation.

"Hehehehe, hehehehehehehe!"

The teeth of the demon bite into Qing's hand.

It's been a while since I've felt pain in my hand, I can't use my internal energy, and at the same time, the energy pulse on my right side is tattered, so the roughly indestructible state of the small number of magicians has been broken.

Well, if we stall like this, how much internal energy does this kid have that it's never going to end no matter how much I pull it out?

So, for now, Qing, who has Siksimma's mouth shut, lets out some random words.

"Excuse me, Mr. Geumma? What is it? Uh, um, isn't the weather really nice?"

"Hmm?"

The swordsman's eyebrows rise and fall sharply.

It has the meaning of being puzzled, like, "Why are you suddenly talking about the weather?"

"No, that's not it."

Then suddenly, a light flashed through Qing's mind.

"That's right! Elder Swordsman, do you happen to know about the Boxer Rebellion?"

"Hmm? The Boxer Rebellion? What is that?"

"So, it is a gathering of martial artists who share their martial arts skills, study together, share the results, and reach a higher level together."

The Qing Dynasty explained about the Boxer Rebellion, a group that aimed to share and distribute martial arts.

"Hmm. I see."

"I think you're a good match for Elder Geomma. Why not throw away your Blood Cult and join the Boxers? You won't have to hide in the shadows as a Blood Cult outcast. You'll be respected as a proud master of the Hyeon-gyeong under the bright sun, and you'll be able to collect those martial arts you love."

"I don't like it."

In Qing's opinion, it seemed pretty good.

But the swordsman gave an answer right away without any hesitation.

"Huh? Why?"

"Why, why should I hang out with those lunatics? If what you're saying is true, then I should also give up my martial arts. Why should I give up my martial arts to those guys?"

"Well, you can share the martial arts of the Boxers, too. Even if you're facing ten opponents, you'll give one and receive ten. If you want to acquire multiple martial arts—"

"Why? Why bother?"

He understood it in one go.

Why are you sharing my martial arts when you can just take it?

Before that, the martial arts that were stolen were already 'my martial arts', and the attitude of threatening me by pointing a knife at me was also like asking me to quickly give up 'my martial arts'.

Well, it's just a different way of thinking.

Even though he had a gentle demeanor and was open to conversation, the leader of the Blood Cult was still a human scum.

Even if someone is gentle, he is still a murderer, and just because someone can talk doesn't mean they can understand.

The only person in the world that matters is yourself, and others are nothing more or less than boxes containing the things you need.

If you're worried about what's inside the box, you're just going to take the trouble to open it. Otherwise, it's just a rock, and you can break it, burn it, or throw it away.

If nothing else is important, then even if you wear human skin, you are not human.

Because people are formed from relationships between people.

"hmm?"

The swordsman's gaze suddenly turns downwards.

The amount of blood seeping out from under the crushed flesh of the swollen body of the Siksimma is unusual.

Moreover, upon examining the statue, I noticed that the swollen body of the Siksimma was subtly withering away.

"Hey, could you please loosen up your mouth a bit? He's already an adult, so it doesn't look good."

"This guy and I aren't adults or anything, are we? One of us has to die."

"Even so, a warrior must possess a certain dignity. That's what it means. From what I understand, your share will be substantial. What on earth will your juniors learn from?"

"There's so much to learn. The will to sacrifice oneself and serve others to destroy evil? The resolve of a true villain, unhesitatingly punishing the wicked? The attitude of a white-clad soldier, abandoning everything to defeat the Blood Cult's arch-demon? The life lesson that, regardless of one's status, one must be determined at every moment? Doing your best is..."

Qing thought to herself, muttering.

You clueless little bastard, if you're going to waste my time like this, you should just make a surprise attack with that hideous dance move. Why are you just blankly watching and thinking it's funny?

Qing finally turns her eyes and sends a signal to Kim Heo-jung.

It was only then that Kim Heo-jung began to dance, his neck twitching, but how could the swordsman not notice his obvious hints?

The black horse kicked the ground and jumped straight in.

Qing raises his arm in front of Shiksimma, following his personal belief that the enemy's body is the best shield.

The sword of the sword suddenly stopped, and in an instant it was pulled back towards Qing's right arm.

Qing shakes the arm of the Shikshimma he holds in his hand, blocking the path of the Tao.

It was a breathtaking sight, with their fat bodies swaying between them, one standing and swinging a knife in the air, while the other sat and swung the other's arm wildly.

However, if he could use his internal energy, it would be different, but Qing is also unable to use his internal energy.

Moreover, the left arm of the Shikshimma that Qing wields is heavier than the sword of the swordsman, so Qing cannot help but be unable to keep up with the speed.

Finally, as I hastily withdrew my right arm in front of the fierce river crossing, bang! The hand stuck in my mouth fell out, and my two front teeth popped out together.

"You sucker demon! You sucker demon! You sucker demon!!! You're a sucker demon!!! You sucker demon!! Save me!! You're trying to steal my affections!!"

Sword Demon's expression hardened.


CHAPTER 941

At that moment, Qing moves one step faster.

Qing's intelligence is at its peak right now.

He wasn't inherently stupid, but he never thought to use his brilliant mind. Still, he used his intelligence to the fullest when fighting, so he never let his brain idle.

So now that his intelligence has reached its peak, he immediately finds the answer to what he needs to do, what he must do right now.

The blue's right hand moved, and the index and middle fingers shot into both eye sockets!

"AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!"

At the same time, Qing jumps back.

The expression on his face as he lifts his head high and examines the sword horse with his left arm on the ground is very proud and high-spirited.

How can I fight the swordsman in my current state?

If you hold on to the sword while letting go of the food spirit, the food spirit will be freed from the constraints of its internal energy and will run wild.

He did manage to tear off one of Shiksimma's arms.

However, since Shiksimma's specialty is the wind, he should be able to shoot the wind with just one arm.

There, the swordsman will use his disciples to gain a numerical advantage, so the situation is even more unfavorable.

Then, why can't we just stop the wind from shooting?

So, what do you think, what should we do now?

That was the moment.

The swordsman let go of his sword, then grabbed the flesh of the demon and lifted it up in a flash.

Then he immediately turns around and runs away.

"Huh."

A sharp escape without a single moment of hesitation!

Given the nature of the swordsman who only cares about himself, Qing had expected that he would rush in without any regard for his temper or lack of courage.

So, the reaction is bound to be a beat late.

"You bastard!! Where are you running off to!"

Along with Kim Heo-jung's roar, a fiercely spinning block of ice falls towards the fleeing sword horse.

It's like a falling star!

The swordsman's response to him was simple.

The swordsman threw the food spirit with all his might.

Kim Heo-jung, who was spinning and rushing forward, collided with the flying Shiksimma's gigantic body and bang!

In the aftermath, Kim Heo-jung's orbit is distorted and he falls with a bang, shattering the ground, and the food spirit that collided with him is flung far away.

Something flying in all directions is the giant body of the Shiksimma spinning and flying, vomiting blood as if it had suffered a major internal injury.

Then, a shadow of a person suddenly jumps up.

It was the sight of a swordsman who took and took back the very thing he had thrown away.

Does this mean that my safety comes first and then rescue comes second?

"Hey! You little bastard! Where are you running off to! Aren't you coming? Are you scared? Are you scared of me?"

----

The swordsman shuddered.

The Thousand Flower Sword was a demonic spirit?

So, are you saying that you've been hiding your identity and coveting my expedition all this time, biding your time?

It was fortunate that Gongryang Sa-yoon was always by his side, and that his disciple followed him and showed his face. If it weren't for them, he would have been left a dried-up corpse with all his energy sucked out long ago.

My heart sank as I thought about it.

He was acting scary while grumbling and showing off his martial arts skills. It's common for a warrior to not give up their martial arts skills even when they die. He probably thought that even if he gave up his martial arts skills, he could just kill him later.

Seriously, she is no ordinary woman.

Beneath the kind, smiling face and gentle voice, there must have been only an evil intention to suck the affection out of others.

Geomma thought that Qing had been a demonic spirit from the beginning, so he was dizzy thinking that the way she had shown him so far was fake and that she was biding her time.

After all, it's only been two days since Qing fled from Baekdu Mountain.

It's unlikely that he would have picked up the secret of the Absorbing Magic in the meantime. Even if he had been lucky enough to pick it up, it's not something he could have mastered in just two days.

So, it was a reasonable conclusion for the swordsman.

The true identity of the Cheonhwa Sword was a vampire witch!

How could such a high achievement be so out of place for someone of her age? How many people must have been sucked to death by the cruel desires of that terrible, sucking witch!

The swordsman's mistake was not because he was stupid.

Who in the world would think that one could learn and use martial arts in the same way as Qing - by rolling one's eyes, foaming at the mouth, and groaning incoherently?

Because the brainwashing training itself was a very mysterious coincidence that no normal person could have even imagined from the beginning.

So the black horse ran away.

Because that vicious mind was scary, and there was no reason to face the worst magic of the absorption magic, the killing magic.

You might laugh at me for being such a master of the current situation and running away shamefully when you can't even handle a single witch.

People don't really care if bugs like snails or cicadas enter their homes.

Because snails and slugs cannot harm humans no matter what they do.

By the way, what about mosquitoes and fleas?

Mosquitoes and fleas suck human blood and tickle people, so kill them as soon as you see them.

But mosquitoes and fleas cannot kill people no matter how hard they try. So, even if you hate mosquitoes and fleas and kill them, no one will avoid or avoid doing so.

But what if a dangerous, venomous creature like a poisonous snake or spider enters your home?

At that time, you will have to call in someone to clean up such poison, or threaten them from afar and block their way to get them out.

Because such poison is enough to kill a person.

R1o1RUY1V2dWdFByellBWDZwUWJGWXJVdS9hMXQzM2x0SkI2WHh4eTNaWHMrdm1sWUtiZGI2dVR2VlFxOHJrYw

Why risk being bitten by such a poison yourself?

That's just the foolish ramblings of a fool, a wise man would never bother to deal with it.

Because the swordsman worked so hard to calm his mind.

"Ugh, ugh! My eyes! I can't see!!"

"Shut up! That witch is coming after you!"

"Eek. No, no. Hehe."

At that, Shikshimma was so shocked that he shut his mouth abruptly.

Even though the pain must have been extraordinary, with her arms torn off, her scrotum cut off, and both her eyes blown out.

Not only that, but he started shaking like a trembling aspen tree.

The black horse clicks its tongue.

Instead of being angry when you hear the name of your enemy, you tremble in fear and shut your mouth?

If the fear that has engraved in his soul is this much, he will never be able to even look at the Cheonhwageom again.

If the leader of a single battle group has a phobia toward the enemies of the Blood Cult, for the sake of the future of the cult—

At that moment, the swordsman smiles bitterly.

Well, since both of his eyes are blasted out, he won't be able to make eye contact with anyone, even if it's not Cheonhwageom.

Since my life as a single person is already over, my position as a single person will also be over.

If so, is there any need to harm it and give room for any possible misunderstanding?

There's no need for that.

So, the two leaders of the Blood Cult ran away through the northern forest with their mouths shut.

----

Meanwhile, the Qing did not bother to pursue the fleeing Blood Cult leaders.

The danjeon was just swollen, but the internal injuries or the details of the arms were not restored.

Although he can move his right arm well, he cannot exert much force, and his pelvis is cracked, causing excruciating pain every time he steps on the ground.

If we pursue them forcefully, we might be able to secure a victory.

Above all, there was something more important to take care of, yes, I have to go take care of the princess… … .

I don't really feel any sense of obligation to the princess.

But the fake Yeonsul, who had not yet been married and was still a princess, was attacked and harmed in the land of barbarians?

Even if Qing, who has no interest in the state of affairs in the world and is ignorant of the Zhongyuan, understands that this is something that cannot be easily overlooked.

Perhaps it is a problem that will lead to war, and if you think about it that way, the purpose of the Blood Cult's attack is also clear, so wouldn't it be transparent?

So much so that the leader himself came forward.

"My lady, are you okay? There's blood…"

"It's not my blood, it's more like, to the princess, oh, so, um, north, north!"

The peace procession was heading northeast along the road when they were attacked, and the Qing lured the enemy behind them, so they headed southwest and jumped into the forest on the left, and after the engagement, they decided to get as far away as possible and headed south.

"Princess… are you speaking?"

"I was escorting the princess on her peace trip when the Blood Cult attacked and I was luring the enemy away?"

"Oh, wasn't there a huge uproar? On my way to the headquarters, ahem, no, on my way to deal with those evil bastards, I tricked the sword demon and infiltrated the Blood Cult's den. Seriously. Even if the Zhongyuan scum deserved to die, how could I possibly associate with a group like the Blood Cult that harms innocent lives? This is not the way of a gentleman, nor is it the way of a scholar. I will always deceive them, find their base, and wipe them all out..."

A deep wrinkle appeared between Qing's eyebrows.

This kid is also not ordinary in his shamelessness.

Anyway, Kim Heo-jung, who was holding the sword and going to the blood sect to take a woman, suddenly heard a loud noise and the sound of the Six-Hap Battle.

So, in that place, facing the source, there was Qing, who was facing off against Shikshimma.

Well, if I hadn't lured Shiksimma, I might have been completely wiped out.

No, this is not the time.

"Well, Confucius? I'd appreciate it if you could help me out while I'm at it. But I think I should hurry back to the line. My pelvis is a bit cracked, so I can't run. Could you give me a lift?"

I'm not asking you to carry me, nor am I asking you to hug me.

It was quite rude of me to ask someone to give me a ride when I wasn't even pulling a carriage or a cart.

However, it was not a particularly strange expression for Qing, as people were originally a type of vehicle, and Qing was someone who diligently rode the pedestal No. 1 and No. 2.

And it wasn't a particularly strange expression for Kim Heo-jung either. When he was trying to run away with Qing, the first thing he said was, "Get on quickly."

It's not like you're carrying it on your back, since it's placed on an iceberg attached to your back.

So, riding Kim Heo-jung, heading north.

----

On the way north on Kim Heo-jung, this time I was flying high and then, with a bang, I landed on all fours.

Inyeong, who happened to be nearby, was startled and aimed her hand at the strange four-legged beast that suddenly fell from the sky.

But that was only for a moment.

He then ran towards me, then his body flew up and he landed on the ground with a thud.

It was a posture of prostration, with the entire front part of the body touching the floor.

"Oh my, oh my! Oh my! Oh my God! Oh my! It's truly, truly fortunate that you're so safe and sound!! Please forgive me, this thousand things that I couldn't dare to stay by your side!!!"

The eunuch's lament echoes loudly.

The eunuch's mental anguish was not ordinary, because the real princess disappeared after luring the enemy to protect the fake princess.

But the more I followed the trail, the more I found only the ruins of a terribly collapsed forest. If I had known this would happen, I should have revealed Mama's identity and brought Palgi back sooner.

It was a eunuch who had such great regrets.

however?

The Mother has descended on the legendary Black Tortoise, riding on a divine beast, with a mighty roar. As the Son of Heaven, this is the will of Heaven.

"Ah! Blood, blood! I need to get the doctor, I need to get the doctor! Miss, wait a minute, I need to get the doctor right now, Ah, where are you going, Miss, are you okay? What, what should I do?"

"No, it's okay. It's not my blood."

At Qing's calm answer, the eunuch felt a pang of relief and sighed.

Then I noticed Shinsoo's condition. Hmm? Why is Shinsoo so ugly?

It was as if the facial features were human, but it was absolutely not human. And on top of that, the head was covered in flesh-colored, unattractive hair. Was this, a divine beast?

At that moment, Qing's voice cuts off the eunuch's doubts.

"What about the procession? Is your mother okay?"

"Ah! This thing went straight after the young lady, so the captain of the eight-armed cavalry sent his elite warriors to escape. Isn't that okay? That rascal's skills are quite impressive."

"Well, I guess I should go back quickly. They might still be fighting."

So one more person was added to the group.

The world's ugliest man, riding a human beast, is joined by the world's greatest murderer, covered in blood, and an old eunuch with makeup on like a woman!

Anyone who sees them will be suspicious and wary, saying that they are a truly strange group.

The Jurchen salesmen were not like that.

Rather, he had a bright face and a happy expression, so it would be even more unpleasant for someone who didn't know the circumstances to see him.

"Mrs. Seomun! Are you alright?"

And the figure of the leader of the eight-armed faction, Pori, jumping out from among them.

He was greatly relieved.

Oh, the princess seems to be safe.

Of course, if something had happened to the princess, the captain of the guard, Pori, would not have been able to welcome her so warmly.

Well, I guess so?


PART 93 Is the Feast Over?
Reference to Korean Muhyeob novel 'The Bird That Drink Tears'

CHAPTER 942

The time to collect the bodies of the fallen Eight Banner warriors passed quickly.

They collect the body, attach a makeshift stretcher to the horse, place the body on it, and secure it firmly.

The dead horse was buried shallowly, its harness was kept separately, and the living horse was redistributed.

The advance party, which was annihilated after encountering the Shiksim Demon before the main force, was reassembled… …

The atmosphere is truly suffocating.

The Eight Banners who went on the peace journey were elites from each Eight Banners, respected warriors, and comrades and friends of the survivors.

The atmosphere is so awkward that it's hard to stay in the room because you feel embarrassed and sorry for asking for nothing.

In fact, there was absolutely no reason for Qing to feel such emotions.

Because Siksimma had his eye on the princess from the beginning.

Rather, if Qing had not provoked Madu and dragged him out due to his bad relationship with Shiksimma, wouldn't the elite Eight Banners have almost disappeared from the world?

But the reason why Qing felt embarrassed was because he was lying there blankly while watching the whole scene.

The eunuch who saw Qing limping started crying (literally, crying a lot) and making a fuss.

When the body was collected and the deceased was placed in the burial chamber, they would have laid the body down and made a fuss, demanding that silk and cotton be brought out, and would have made something that was somewhere between a bed and a stretcher.

Because the materials were insufficient and there were no walls or lids, it was truly difficult to lie on the stretcher-bed in full view.

While taking care of the dead and seriously injured, Qing, who seemed to be in good spirits on the outside, seemed to be making a fuss...

Hmm. I want to go home.

I really want to go home.

As Qing looked around in embarrassment, he saw a giant hunchback on the other side, diligently helping to clean up the aftermath of the attack.

Well, the ugly guy is a good kid… … .

But fortunately, the atmosphere completely changed as soon as the training was over.

As the procession started, they all started laughing and chatting as if nothing had happened, as if the solemnity and sorrow from earlier had passed away with the thought that 'there was a brief commotion'.

As Qing was blinking in that atmosphere, a splendid horseman lined up with a stretcher being pulled by a horse.

It was the captain of the escort force, Pori.

"Are you feeling well? I truly owe you a great favor. I already knew the power of the Ma-Hwang, so if you hadn't intervened, we would have been annihilated."

"Um, are you okay?"

He looked up at the distant sky.

"The dead ascend to heaven and become ancestral spirits, guardian spirits of the clan. In Chinese terms, they're called ancestors or forefathers. However, after they're buried and return to the earth, this happens seven days later."

According to Jurchen customs, after burying and performing ancestral rites, the spirit would simply wander around for seven days.

But these lost souls are in a very sad state.

So, when something interesting happens, they immediately run over and hang around, and then the death energy that the ghost holds spreads to the living.

The content of this interesting work was as follows.

Hunting, dueling, singing.

This was also a hobby enjoyed by warriors.

And since all Jurchen were warriors, hunting, fighting, and singing were prohibited for the seven days during which a Jurchen was buried.

And another thing that catches the interest of the lost soul.

It's your own name.

When you hear your own name, you immediately run to listen, and although the ghost doesn't have any malicious intentions, the aura of death spreads.

So when someone dies, we mourn, but we do not show our sadness and do not mention their name so that the deceased does not feel sad.

Even so, don't go as far as the hunting duel song, it seems like you're having too much fun with someone dying.

In fact, all funeral customs in the world are like this.

Even when the dead are gone, the living must continue on, so isn't a funeral supposed to help those left behind not be overcome by grief?

There are differences, such as if you want to be more solemn and cry, or if you want to be completely festive and laugh and drink and enjoy yourself, but in the end, a funeral is a ceremony to comfort the living.

Thanks to this, Qing was also able to put his mind at ease.

As the peace procession continued, the village they arrived at late at night was called Palgabo.

As you can tell from the name, it was a village where eight clan villages lived together, so it was quite prosperous for a village in the mountains.

It was late at night, but after soaking my body in hot water, my pelvis, which had been aching all along, felt like it was starting to heal a little.

Of course, it was just a feeling.

Otherwise, the bones won't suddenly stick together.

Of course, it was a real pain for the nameless villagers who had to fetch water in the middle of the night and boil it to fill their bathtubs.

Of course, it must have been just a feeling.

Otherwise, we would have to complain to the salesmen and ask why we should do this.

But Qing doesn't know.

I guess it's just the bathwater I paid for, so it's not exactly Qing's fault.

When my hair was long, drying it was a real pain.

Even if a hot wind blows, it takes a long time. How much more difficult must it have been in the primitive ancient times before the development of civilization?

But I'm tired, um, I guess I'll just sleep...

My pelvis hurts so much I can't shake my head...

When a bone is cracked, even the slightest movement causes pain, interfering with daily life.

So, um, I don't know, let's just sleep...

And then, knock. There's a knock on the door.

-Uh, are you there?

"Yes, I am here."

-Ugh… …

And then it was quiet, but the sound of people standing in front of the door did not disappear.

Even after quite some time had passed.

-If you go in, "What are you doing? Why aren't you coming in?"

And then, even though it was polished cleanly, it was still ugly. No, it seemed to have looked better when it was dirty and had something on it. That ugly man, Kim Heo-jung, entered the room.

"Ouch, it's my pelvis."

"Well, lie down. Um. But."

And then you came in like that? You stood in the middle of the room, fidgeting and hesitating, unable to do anything.

"What are you doing? Why are you frozen?"

"It's my first time entering a woman's room. Hmm, so that's what it looked like."

He is speechless.

There were only two inns in the village, so they invited guests to the larger one.

"No, Confucius, your room and mine are exactly the same. Why, can we switch? Do you want to use this room?"

"Still, something is different. It, yes, something, yes, something fragrant!"

Well, the eunuch secretly stole the princess' perfume and poured it into the bathtub, so it couldn't help but be fragrant.

"Well, that's fine. But… um… are you leaving?"

Qing looked at Kim Heo-jung and asked.

Well, since he showed up in the middle of the night fully dressed and carrying a backpack, anyone with eyes would have been able to tell that he was going somewhere.

"Ah. Yes. That's right, that's right."

He hesitated for a moment.

Is it okay for a cute guy to learn the fairy technique?

It's not a problem with the original, but it's already distorted due to the influence of other martial arts, so even if the original is changed, the distorted state will remain the same.

The heavily made-up face of the old eunuch flashed through Qing's mind.

If I make a mistake and end up with something like dark evolution, wouldn't I end up becoming a bizarre monster that's neither male nor female?

Well, I guess I have to think about it.

Come to think of it, it's not something I should be worrying about.

You can tell Kim Heo-jung about the dangers, and if he wants, you can teach him. If he doesn't want to, then there's nothing you can do about it, right?

Qing-i made up her mind and was about to open her mouth, but, hmm? What's the state of the ugly man?

For some reason, he can't make eye contact and is just glancing around.

I clenched and unclenched my fists, wiped the sweat off my pants, and then, not knowing where to put them, I brought them forward and clutched my backpack behind my back, unable to decide where to put them.

"Well, why? Don't be so difficult. Just tell me."

"Ah, that! Um, ahem, didn't I save your life? So, I have a favor to ask of you…"

"Well, it's a bit ambiguous whether he was a lifesaver or not, but if you hadn't brought the sword horse in the first place, I would have ended up fighting Shiksimma too, right?"

"That is, my lady, even if that wicked bastard, Geomma, had not been deceived by my scheme and joined the Blood Cult, he would have joined the Blood Cult. But if I hadn't followed him just in case—"

"No, I'm just kidding. I appreciate it. Thanks to you, I'm alive, really."

"So what I'm saying is, uh, one last time, just let me touch your chest…."

Qing's expression suddenly turned sour.

"Hey, hey! It was going well, but this is going to end badly. They say all's well that ends well, but this is ending really badly, so it's a total mess."

Kim Heo-jung then creates a distorted expression that is presumed to be a resentful expression.

"No, isn't that okay? It's not like it'll wear down if you touch it, and if you could just let me rub it for a little while—just this angle, no, half an hour, no, just an hour—so that this poor thing can remember it for the rest of its life, how can you be so cruel?"

For reference, in the Qing Dynasty's homeland, a unit of time is 15 minutes, and an hour is two hours.

No, what, after saying that, it seems like it was short, so I guess I just extended the time, but what's two hours? This is nonsense.

Qing's eyes are constantly twitching over his eyelids, wow, this kid is really consistent until the end...

Then, soon, I let out a sigh.

But, somehow, I think I know.

"Okay. Joomulluck. So, over the clothes?"

"Well, if we're going to do it, let's see it with our own eyes…"

"Then one by one."

"No, my lady-"

"Just pick one. What are you going to do?"

"I will do it one by one……."

Then Qing snorted.

"I thought I had made a rather unusual friend, but I guess not with Prince Kim. Well, a clean deal would be fine, wouldn't you? He gave me a piece of his mind in exchange for my life. A clean deal, isn't it? Sir."

Then Kim Heo-jung was surprised.

"That, my lady? Were we friends?"

"Wasn't that so? Friends are people who greet each other happily when they meet, and naturally suggest having a meal together. So, do we have to offer sacrifices to the gods of heaven and earth and register with the government office to announce it to the whole world to be considered friends?"

Kim Heo-jung had a stupid expression.

Qing sighed at that! Her pelvis hurt!

Miss, I can't even breathe.

Why do you ask that I at least let you touch my heart since you saved my life?

Well, we won't be seeing each other again.

If it works out, great, if it doesn't, then don't worry. If it doesn't work out, then you'll just end up looking like a weird and dirty guy, so what's the big deal since we won't see each other in the future?

furthermore.

I knew it wasn't something I could say honestly because I was hesitant to look at it, and even though I didn't think it was honest myself, I insisted on saying it anyway.

I know it's dirty and vulgar, but I don't think I'll ever have another chance like this in my life.

Well, it's not so bad if you weigh the gains and losses.

Why, I can't stand it when my heart pounds. I miss Heemae too, um. If you had come with me in the first place, I wouldn't have seen this. Um, anyway.

But are those profits and losses all there is?

If we part ways on good terms, we may meet again later and be happy to see each other, so it will be a happy time for both of us.

What's so great about being a friend?

People who know each other more become friends, and friends evolve into best friends, and then eventually, they become close friends who swear at each other (that's not what I meant), and we say we're friends for life and take weird pictures.

But, I guess that was after I had already given up without even realizing it.

He had no friends because he was training in the mountains, and after he became distorted, he probably only received contempt because of his appearance, let alone friends.

I've never had a friend, so I don't know what a friend is, and I've already given up on the idea that there will never be one.

As a former plague ghost, I know that feeling well.

At first, he tried to get people to treat him like a pitiful invalid, picking up trash and pretending to be sick and pitiful in front of others, trying to get them to pay attention.

But what happens after you realize that these kids have such bad personalities?

Well, I did some frost in the field, avoided the beggars' eyes and looked at the trash cans, got beaten up, grabbed the hem of my pants to ask for money for my work, and got dirty.

If you don't intend to form a relationship in the first place, you don't necessarily try to look good, so you end up calculating your own interests first.

but.

It is natural for people to become vulgar when times get tough.

Someone said that to see a person's true character, look at them when they are in trouble, but in my opinion, there is no such thing as bullshit in the world.

A person's true character is revealed when he or she has free time, and when times are tough, it is natural that my own pain takes priority.

Even in difficult times, a person who puts others first is a superhuman who deserves respect.

If you want to date someone like that, you have to be qualified yourself. You're the kind of person who analyzes and re-evaluates the nature of your friend and thinks, "This person is qualified to be my friend."

A guy like that probably doesn't have any real friends.

No matter how ugly Kim Heo-jung is in the world, his martial arts skills are even uglier, his insides are even uglier, and he is a lustful dreamer who harbors a deep resentment towards women.

Because we've been friends ever since he came back to help me.

How can we be friends already?

That's why you and me, us.

The world that expands to us through entanglement of fate expands even when I do not want it to, so it can be infinitely vast.

We cannot be together at every moment, and we will eventually crumble and disappear, which is vain and fleeting.

However, it is a relationship that makes people live infinitely, expanding without limits.

Suddenly, something deep within Qing's mind increases its length.

The world I understand on my own, the city's Taoist heart carved with Samhwa, is filled with even greater abundance.

Well, of course, if you only think of me as a friend and don't like ugly guys, then there's nothing I can do.

"Okay, let's decide. Chin-woo, is it your heart?"

"……Friend, I will keep you as my friend……."

Qing nodded in agreement.


CHAPTER 943

"By the way, if there's a way to change that face, could you try? But maybe it won't work. There's something called the Fairy Arts in the Zhongyuan."

Qing explained about the Taeeumoknyeo Shingong.

If you do this, you can be born as a very beautiful woman like a flower. (I didn't say she was a real flower though)

However, I cannot guarantee the results.

Maybe you could try to get a eunuch on board with that face, I'll help you, but the decision is up to Kim-

"I will do it."

It was an immediate answer without even the slightest hesitation, before Qing's explanation had even finished.

"What difference would it make if things got even worse here? A debt of one hundred nyang is different from a debt of one thousand nyang, but whether it's one million nyang or ten million nyang, it's an amount that can never be repaid, no matter how many generations pass by."

"Hmm. About that much, um. Hmm."

"Why are you stopping talking? You could at least say it wasn't that bad."

Qing slowly lowers his head.

Well, I can't lie. Honestly, even if I were uglier there, what difference would it make from now?

"You need to think carefully. Hyunmumu's bet is purely a skill, so it won't work with Hyuneum's Taeeumoknyeo Shingong. If that's the case, then you'll have to scatter all the enemy attacks you've accumulated so far—"

"Oh, then that's impossible."

It was another sharp answer.

But why do you keep interrupting people?

"No, why? You said you were sick of Hyunmumu?"

"It's not that I don't like it. Breaking the enemy's advance is impossible. If I had my way, I'd abandon this damned study a long time ago, come down to the mountains, and live a normal, beautiful, big-hearted life, with nine beautiful daughters, and a bustling, noisy life."

"Well, people are really consistent. But?"

"Do you see the turtle shell on my back?"

Some martial arts are imitations of objects or animals that resemble them.

There were more than one or two Qing martial artists.

The Tathagata Goddess wanted to resemble the great omnipotence of the Shakyamuni Buddha, and the Emperor Sword Type wanted to resemble the emperor who sits on a throne and controls the world.

Even if that's not the case, there are different types of martial arts that imitate beasts, such as Ho-Kwon, Pyo-Kwon, and Sa-Kwon.

Among the four guardian deities, the Sabangmu imitated the four great beasts, and the Hyeonmumu sought to resemble the Hyeonmu, the guardian deity of the North.

And, as you use these martial arts, the object you want to resemble will take root in your mind, and you will also begin to resemble that object both internally and externally.

Those who use the Ho-Kwon will become as violent as a tiger, those who use the Pyo-Kwon will have traces as pale as a leopard, and those who use the Won-Kwon will have long limbs like a monkey.

Then what about Hyunmu-mu? Does it transform into a human turtle itself, with the appearance of a Hyunmu?

Of course not.

Properly cooked black sesame seeds were not like that.

The problem was that Kim Heo-jung tried to hit the enemy with his own attributes in the way he had learned, so he mixed up the training methods and inserted new ones, making a complete mess.

As a result, it ended up becoming a training method that sought to resemble the imaginary animal Black Tortoise itself, rather than trying to resemble the abilities of the northern incarnation that rules the water.

The result was the black ice that grew on his back, which was a crystallized water essence that had condensed the water energy of the natural body.

"If I try to disperse my internal energy, the water energy flowing from this turtle shell will be blocked and clump together. Instead, the water energy will accumulate, increasing my internal energy. So, unable to abandon this damn martial art, I've lived like this..."

What does that mean?

Qing failed to hold back her exclamation.

"Wow, infinite internal energy! I'm enjoying it endlessly!"

At that, Kim Heo-jung's expression suddenly crumpled.

"What use is my own internal energy when dealing with the secrets of nature?"

It really didn't fit.

Infinite internal energy seems good, but unfortunately, the Black Tortoise barely consumed any internal energy within its dantian, so it was only used to the extent of gathering and responding to the natural energy.

"Well, how can I break it? Well, it was fine even when Hyun-kyung beat it. No, it was easily destroyed by the strong wind that Shiksim-ma shot. Then, wouldn't it be better to ask a stronger expert?"

"I could die. They say even rolling in shit is better than this life, right? I don't want to risk my life trying..."

"hmm."

Qing stroked his smooth chin.

It's a bit of a shame that it gets blocked before you even try.

How could there be no other way?

Since the water energy must be suppressed by the wood energy, it should be in a place with abundant wood energy, um, but the water energy of the Suneung-saengmok creates wood, so if the wood energy is abundant, the place will also become abundant with water energy.

Or if you subdue it with a bigger firearm, well, if you roast it a bit, that won't work.

Is there any way to remove the manual?

"Well, I think there's a way. If something seems strange, just stop. What do you think? I'll try—"

"Let's do it right now!"

It seems like he wanted to throw away all his martial arts and everything by cutting off his words again.

Qing extends her hand to him.

"Okay, hands."

"Hand, are you talking?"

"Give me your hand. I'm going to absorb your internal energy from now on. If you don't want to rush the expedition, you have to tell me as soon as your internal energy runs out."

The Bukmyeongsingong stops the operation of internal energy and absorbs the bet, so if it keeps sucking up the crystals and such, won't it melt and disappear?

Qing grabs Kim Heo-jung's wrist.

And the blood vessel leading to the heart was opened, and it was the moment when the flow of other people's energy was connected to the lowest sea in the world.

An unfamiliar energy flows into the blue.

The bet of the Shiksim Demon was something that Qing was already familiar with as it was a Shiksim Demon energy, but the Hyunmu Jin energy, which was condensed into pure water energy, was something new that Qing had never experienced before.

A refreshing breeze that feels cool and refreshing, like being splashed with sap on a hot, boiling day.

And finally, it flowed into the dantian, took hold somewhere in the dantian, and began to grow in size.

Clink, clunk, swoosh… … .

Inside the Qing Dynasty's Danjeon is a peaceful beach.

Amidst the bright, burning energy of the sun casting a bright light, on the wide white sandy beach, children of all shapes and sizes, each wearing different clothing with their own unique personalities, were enjoying the beach in their own way.

The iceberg towering over the nearby sea is, upon closer inspection, the ice crystal of the Bingbaek Shingong.

The Ice King, perched on top, looks down at the other Ice Kings floating in the sea, each with a round air pocket beneath the iceberg.

On one hand, they bounce and hit the ball, making a lot of noise and groaning, and it is a truly bizarre sight.

The true spirits of Jeongjong and the magical spirits of Sado, who were unable to eat each other, were mingling together and looking very cheerful. What kind of sight was this?

But, the sea is a place that embraces all water. Even the most solemn person, lying on a peaceful beach, can't help but smile warmly.

Even the exposure-addicted little Hwanhee Jinki, who was impatient because he couldn't catch magic, let go of his usual sharp gaze and was swimming around happily.

Of course, even in the midst of all this, there was Pacheonmagi, crouching alone in a corner, doodling and writing on the floor with his finger.

The sea doesn't just accept water, it accepts any liquid, so there are things that don't mix like water and oil.

The letters that Pacheonmagi writes on the white sand beach are 咯咯咯咯, and when pronounced out loud, it sounds like kekekekeke.

The Pacheonmagi is laughing anyway…

A peaceful Danjeon world today too.

Today is a truly peaceful Danjeon world.

If you look closely, you can see a door suddenly opening and someone appearing in the painted background.

The blue fabric was covered in wave patterns, but somehow it was soaking wet. His hair was wet, his skin was wet, and his clothes were wet, making him look a bit unsightly.

That's right, Hyunmujingi!

At the appearance of the new Jin-gi, whoosh! The Hwanhee Jin-gi, who had fiercely cut through the waves and swam to the shore, rushed forward, digging through the sand.

Then, standing tall.

Hwanhee Jinki takes a step back.

What does Hyunmujingi look like?

The eyes are white and have no pupils, so only the whites of the eyes are visible.

He walked in with both arms outstretched, with a roar that didn't sound like intelligence.

Then, suddenly, he turned his head to the side!

At the same time, he ran out fiercely, and there was Joo Yang-se-sim-gi with a bewildered expression.

Then, Hyunmu Jinki flies forward and lands on Juyang Sesimgi, crushing him.

The startled Juyang Sesimgi was suddenly struck by the Hyunmujingi, who had been holding down the head.

The mouths of the little ones meet, and the pupils of the eyes of the master of the household dilate greatly.

Slurp slurp! A moist sound… … .

The Jin-gis each covered their faces and looked through their fingers, saying, "Oh my god."

Qing lies down at an angle and examines the martial arts window.

Qing originally preferred to lie on his back with his arms and legs spread out like a frog, but he had no choice because his pelvis on the lower left side was cracked.

Still, with every breath, the pain spread faintly, and Qing stared at the martial arts window with her eyebrows slightly furrowed.

Is this the state of the internal energy method?

Since all of the internal energy methods of the martial arts window had reached the level of the twelve great stars, even the girl's joy and ice water magic, who had not invested in training points for some reason, had achieved great success.

That was the function of Bukmyeongsingong.

Well, still, I'm not terribly sensitive or anything. Just a lucky balance, huh?

In fact, this was something Qing couldn't know yet, because how could he feel anything else when his bones were cracked and he was in pain just from breathing?

anyway.

The internal energy of the Shiksim Demon was so immense that it filled Qing's dantian to the brim, but all of that overflowing energy leaked out in vain.

I couldn't tell if this was a characteristic of Bukmyeongsingong, or if it was because of the internal energy system of this martial arts spear style that only I had, and because once I achieved the Twelve Great Stars, I couldn't build up any more internal energy with that method.

After absorbing Kim Heo-jung's internal energy, Qing was able to understand the Bukmyeong Shingong a little more.

In the case of Shiksimma, since it was a true energy that I had already mastered, I filled the Shiksimma energy first, and then the remaining energy filled the other true energies.

But what about the ugly guy?

After sucking in the Hyunmujinki, I felt a strange sensation as if an unknown energy had gathered in my danjeon and filled it with something.

But this Hyunmujinki doesn't work.

No matter how hard you try, it won't be possible to operate it because it won't budge within the Danjeon.

No, what is this?

If I absorb all that energy but can't use it, what's the point of absorbing it? Is this the ultimate martial arts? What kind of ultimate is the name of the neighbor's dog?

But that was only for a moment.

I wonder if the other Jin-gis are not listening to me. I tried floating a few of the Juyang Sesimgi Sunset Rings.

At that moment, the Hyunmu Jinki moved, and its nature changed, filling the Juyang Sesimgi.

At that moment, Qing understood immediately.

If you suck in the true energy of an unlearned mind method, you can store it in your dantian up to the level of the twelve great saints.

The true energy that has been absorbed in this way is replenished again through the absorption of Bukmyeongsingong.

So, this is a spare battery!

By absorbing various types of energy and increasing the number of types, you can accumulate internal energy equivalent to twelve stars per type.

How many internal energy methods are there in the world?

Besides, I am not yet in a position to use all parts of the Bukmyeongsingong.

Qing recalls the secret of Bukmyeongsingong that came into being through brainwashing.

Rather than a series of incomprehensible scenes, some incomprehensible symbol flashes by -

Suddenly, a sharp, stabbing pain hit my head.

Perhaps, from the beginning, Bukmyeongsingong was not a martial art taught through words or writing.

That demonic cult's mental parasite must have used some kind of magical method, that is, brainwashing.

If you think about it that way, well, if brainwashing is something that can be done through sorcery, then the claim that the martial arts spear is the small martial arts spear could also be quite reasonable… … .

Anyway, even in the body that stabs the head of Bukmyeongsingong, the functions and truths that correspond to the writing of the first-class people come to mind.

Among them, there are two truths that Qing can read.

Absorption results, discharge results,

Absorption is a technique that sucks in internal energy, and delivery is a technique that transmits internal energy.

Well, as for the rest, I guess we'll just have to keep trying.

Just being impatient isn't going to be enough.


CHAPTER 944

The interior was dazzling, with furniture woven from red wood, curtains decorated with golden dragons and phoenixes, and gold and jewel carvings.

No, it was indoors.

Now, all that remains are the remains of the furniture and decorations strewn about, with torn dragons and phoenixes hanging along the torn curtains.

It was a desolate and ruined place, like the palace of a fallen dynasty.

In front of this ruin is a dragon statue built in eight stages.

Perhaps it was a throne of someone more noble than the seven steps of the Forbidden City.

However, since all sides were completely blocked by bedrock, this was clearly an underground space, a very strange space.

What does it mean to have an underground palace, whether it has eight or one hundred and eight levels of dragon statues located underground?

Besides, a palace is a place that should be open to all sides.

The King's Great Hall was a place that had to be open to all directions, including east, west, north, south, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, north-northeast, north-northeast, north-northwest (omitted), etc., so that there were no blind spots.

The reason was to surround the walls on all sides with paper-covered doors and place pillars outside the doors.

A throne that was almost more noble than the Emperor's palace, but ended up being thrown underground and ruined.

Above the ruined Yongsang in Daejeon.

A man was lying down.

He had jade-made prosthetic eyes in both eyes, and one arm was empty, with the hem of his clothes below the elbow missing.

Beneath the thick, thick fragrance, a foul odor was concealed, the stench of filth and putrid pus, the foul stench of a castrated man who has cut off his penis.

Into such a battle, a woman walks with a truly brisk demeanor, stepping once twice.

Even with such gait, there was no sound, so the woman's realm was not low.

The woman, Seopsimmahee Yuryang, smiles brightly, but her voice is filled with worry as she asks.

"Dad, how are you feeling?

"Oh, you were lenient? So, how, how did it turn out? Did you say that bitch can be fixed?"

Yuryang's expression immediately distorts.

But the hungry Shikshimma with his eyes burst out couldn't see that expression.

Yuryang just kept his mouth shut for a long time and glared at Shikshimma.

"Aryang? Ryanga? Are you there?"

After a long time without a response from his daughter, Siksimma asks again in an anxious voice.

Suddenly, the flow of water suddenly became single and then he started screaming!

"Ugh, slut, Cheonchugeom! Ximen Qing, how did you get here! Where am I, no way! Ugh!"

Then, all of a sudden, Siksimma frantically tried to get up, but lost his balance due to his missing elbow, so he fell down awkwardly and rolled down the seven steps.

"Eww! Aaaah!! No! Where are you! Where are you, where are you!"

Still, it's quite unsightly for such a skilled person to lose his balance and fall down just because one of his arms is empty.

It means that he was so scared that he couldn't even control his body properly.

"Eww!!!"

The Shikshimma lying on the floor swung its remaining left arm wildly, and red bullets flew in all directions, causing explosions.

The already broken and shattered debris is shattered into even smaller pieces and flies in all directions, the walls are hollowed out, and the shabby rock shakes off the corn dust.

And then, behind the Shiksim Demon Army, a shadow suddenly appeared, and the shadow, which had the shape of a woman, whispered in Shiksim Demon's ear.

"Eww!!!"

The food demon starts the game, turns his body, and swings his left arm wildly.

However, the woman, Chae Jae, a member of the Shiksimdan detachment, skillfully dodged the attack by lying down.

And after a while.

After a while of raging, the food stallion stopped and slowly, quietly, whispered again.

"Eek! No! Save me! Save me!!"

The demon convulses again, screaming and scattering bullets all around.

Meanwhile, Yuryang had already stuck his head out the door and was watching the scene with a smile.

Then at some point, bang!

The flow pushes the door as hard as if it were going to break.

And then he made an urgent voice that didn't match his expression that was so funny he could die.

"Dad!? Are you okay, Dad!? Dad!"

"Huh, Aryang, Aryang?"

"Again, did you hear things again? It's okay, I said it's okay. How did that Cheonchugeom bitch know where I was? I told you it was all hallucinations. She's possessed by a demon."

It was a truly shameless act of deafness to say that I was actually saying it out loud.

Even Yuryang looked at Chaejae and exchanged eye smiles, his expression looking like he was dying of amusement. This shows how important eyesight is to a person.

"No, no, that's not it……"

"Fine. What's wrong with that? I'm so embarrassed I can't live. I'm so scared of that girl, hearing things and having fits? That's what a father is, sigh..."

"You, what, what kind of habit is that-"

"Okay, don't say anything. Actually, I got a call from Representative Un—"

"What, what did you say? The treatment, it's going to be a treatment, right?"

"They say if you want to put eyes in, you have to pluck out the eyes of a relative. A parent or a child. But Dad has lost both Mom and Dad, and I'm the only child left? So, you're going to pluck out my eyes?"

"that……."

Shiksimma mumbles and trails off.

Then, the words that Yuryang uttered were quite touching.

"Okay. I have two eyes, so even if you take one out, I'll still be able to see. But, even then, if it's not your own eye, it's blurry and you won't be able to see very well. The size just doesn't match? Just keep that in mind."

"……! Ryang-ah, you're so generous, ugh……!"

The sound of a hungry horse sobbing.

In some ways, it could be a very touching moment, but the expression on Yuryang's face as he looks down at him is cold and only a cold smile.

I close the door to Daejeon, which has become a ruin of a deep tunnel, and walk out through the underground passage.

Next to him, the strong man, Chae Jae, walked side by side, chatting away.

"Ah, today was fun. No matter how many times I do it, I never get tired of it. Thanks to our youngest, this older sister's life is worth living, really."

"But, Sister, do I really need to give it some attention? Can't I just leave it like this?"

"Well, at the Danju meeting, there was talk of dealing with and replacing the Subsimma Hwang. A blind man is just too useless. So, if you give him one eye, he'll keep his position as Danju."

In fact, one eye was also a fatal weakness for a human, because with only one eye, the distance between the left and right would be distorted, making it impossible to measure distances properly.

It would be a particularly big weakness for the Shiksim Demon who specializes in shooting out strong winds.

Still, I think it's possible to avoid being completely useless.

From then on, the sound of two women, or more precisely, two zombies, talking continues.

----

Inside the warehouse, there was the constant sound of a dog chewing something.

In the sunlight streaming in through the small window at the top, fine dust floats peacefully.

Then, suddenly, a round thing peeped into the sunlight, revealing its shape brightly.

It was a human eyeball and the long, elegant fingers of a woman holding it.

"Hmm, the color, I guess it's similar to this."

The voice she muttered, her eyes shining in the sunlight, was beautiful in tone, but somehow had a thin edge to it, making her think of a sickly woman.

That was when.

Creak, creak.

The sound of a dog whining.

As the woman lowered her head, a very ugly dog looked up into her eyes and whined in its characteristic dog-like whining sound.

"Oh, Chuguya. Do you want to eat?"

Then, bark! Bark! The barking sound was quite loud, perhaps because it was a large dog.

"Unfortunately, this isn't edible, is it? It's all useful, isn't it? Hmm, but still, should I just take a bite?"

Woof! Woof! The dog's tail was wagging wildly, making it look like its tail was wagging its tail.

That was the moment.

Squeak, the sound of a door opening.

"No, what are you doing in a place like this?"

A dignified old lady with white hair appeared, and when she saw the scene inside the warehouse, she clicked her tongue.

A corpse tied to a chair.

It was the corpse of an old man, his eyes were gaping open, and the screams of his death were clearly visible on his face.

The old lady frowns at him.

"You bastard, Chuguya. You can't use it. You can't use it if you eat that kind of thing."

Squeak, squeak.

The old woman's sullen expression softens slightly as the dog responds with a whining sound.

But that was only for a moment.

"The dog won't eat anything you give it, so why are you feeding it human meat? If you're going to feed it, you should have fed it some fresh meat. It's too old to even eat meat."

The old lady didn't ask about the tied corpse, because to her, it didn't matter whether she steamed the man's corpse, made soup with it, or carved it into art.

A woman puts her eyeballs into a glass jar.

The old lady didn't really react, because she had seen people's organs taken care of several times before, so it wasn't something to be particularly curious about.

"Let's eat. The kids picked a whole bunch of burdock root. It's so plump and looks even tastier than the ones we had in Jungwon."

"Oh my, it's a burdock. Is it already that time of year?"

"It seems that spring is coming even to this remote village."

So the old and young people left the warehouse and chattered.

"Oh, by the way. How did the short-term meeting go?"

"They said they would soon implement the first plan."

"Oh my, it's the first plan. Was it a four-sided house?"

"Yeah. I can't delay any longer. Hehe, that woman called Cheonhwageom really is a tough one, huh?"

"Oh my. Shinpa, you look happy."

"Isn't that funny? When men can't get their hands on a single woman."

The old lady laughs as if she is pleased.

"Anyway, it seems like it'll be harder to crush them now that the Jurchens have switched ships. Oh, yeah, that's interesting. I heard that Cheonhwageom has mastered the magic of absorption."

"Oh my god."

The woman looks surprised.

The woman always had a calm and playful expression, so the old lady smiled with a satisfied smile.

"Well, that's not exactly believable. That bitch was a psychic, so even though two of her comrades were sent in, one of them became disabled and ran away. And then she suddenly started yelling at me. She was using a small-scale magic attack. What on earth does that have to do with anything?"

"Oh my, the absorption magic, and even the small-scale magic? Let's see, the martial arts learned by the Cheonhwa Sword are the true form of the Moon Lady Sword in the Tathagata Shinjang? And on top of that, oh my, didn't you say you learned all ten great magic arts under heaven?"

"Haha! It's just like you said! That woman is actually a great demon among demons who possesses several of the ten greatest demons in the world, and she's not satisfied with that, so she's searching for the ten greatest demons in the world. Didn't that bastard Geomma say that?"

"oh?"

"Tch. Men are such vile creatures. When they lose to a woman, they make excuses for everything, and they find fault with her in any way they can to disparage her. A magician who sucks her desires? Even a dog wouldn't believe that."

Woof! Woof!

An ugly dog that barks at the sound of a dog.

The old lady's expression relaxes somewhat.

"Chugoo, it's fortunate that something so ugly is so clever. That dog wasn't your idea, though. Anyway, he said he'd spread the word that Cheonhwageom was a vampire witch."

"Hmm, do you think that will work?"

"Wouldn't that be so? The Cheonhwageom woman's accomplishments at such a young age were obvious. It's obvious even without looking. The public's heart is inherently unjust and cruel, like the flip of a hand. The world's perception of women is even more vicious."

The old lady frowns and clicks her tongue repeatedly as if she feels sorry.

And he continues speaking in a voice filled with deep regret.

"It's truly a nuisance. When rumors like that spread, the first thing you lose is your hometown. Those who were once the pride of your hometown, the ones you proudly adored, are now leading the charge, cursing you out, saying things like, "I knew you'd be that kind of person," and "I'm afraid they'll get caught up in it, so they're the ones leading the way in causing trouble. When you lose your hometown like that, your heart starts to crumble..."

----

Mother's home in Zigui County, Hubei Province.

"Did you hear that? There's a rumor that Heavenly Blossom Sword is actually a Great Demonic Adept who has mastered the Essence Absorption Demonic Art."

"What, what!?"

The man who heard the rumor was so startled that he trembled.

Was it the betrayal of realizing that the proud local celebrity you trusted was actually a master of the worst magic?

So the man raised his voice, unable to contain his emotions, and trembled.

"As expected, she is the Heavenly Supreme! When on earth did she took the Slaughter Among Killers? All the martial arts in the world are in her hands!"

"No, you see, do you believe that? Isn't this the machinations of some impure group trying to slander Heavenly Supreme's exalted name? We must immediately track down and apprehend those who spread such rumors—"

"What are you talking about? The strongest Demonic Art is only fit for the most revered and honorable being in the world. I believe in you, our Supreme God. May the Heavenly Demon reign supreme!"

Whether you believe the rumors or not, it doesn't really seem to matter.


CHAPTER 945

Last night, he invested time in sucking Kim Heo-jung's energy and emptying his dantian.

Wouldn't it be like the hunchbacked iceberg's protruding hump, broken into small pieces and crumbling, spreading all over the ground, then melting and disappearing into thin air?

Of course, since he was from the Qing dynasty, it wasn't particularly strange, so, um, was the true identity of the ice crystal dried ice?

After that, he taught the Taeeumoknyeo Shingong's ninefold secret and showed a demonstration as a true martial artist, so it was quite late at that time.

So Kim Heo-jung bowed his head deeply and expressed his gratitude.

Qing watched Kim Heo-jung leave with his pack on his back, and wished him good luck, hoping that he would live a good life like a human being.

So I sent Kim Heo-jung away.

But those who leave have left, and those who remain must keep walking.

That's how we welcome a new morning.

"Ugh, ugh. Ugh."

Screams of pain from the morning.

A strong and energetic morning, as always! Qing-i abruptly sat up, sucking in the morning air as a sharp pain stabbed through her pelvis.

The scene of a world-class beauty furrowing her eyebrows and biting her lips is truly delicate, showing off a beauty that cannot be captured in any painting.

What exactly is coming out of a beautiful woman's mouth?

"Ahh, I'm going to lose, really……"

Then, he scratches the scalp on the back of his head very hard, then crawls cautiously down the bed.

Then, he let the thin needle flow naturally onto the floor and looked around.

He patted the back of his shoulders, patted his plump buttocks, patted the back of his neck, patted his bangs back for no reason, patted his sides again, and scratched everywhere, searching for clothes to put on.

Then she tilts her head back, sweeps her hair back, twists it skillfully, and secures it with a sharp steel awl, the Shinnyeomun battle hairpin, with its tip sharpened to a brilliant blue.

Then, breakfast preparations are done!

If it were a Shinnyeomun, Jin Jang-myeong would have wiped some moisture off her face with the wash water she brought along with her nagging.

Qing's body was beyond human, and his skin was also of a superhuman quality. Even after washing his face, his smooth, moist, and lustrous white skin remained clean every day, even without any special care.

By the time I roughly turn over the cotton swab that always hangs in the upper right corner of the bed, I always get goosebumps!

I leave the room, rubbing my stomach as it protests strongly, asking why I didn't eat a late-night snack last night, and excitedly wondering what to eat for breakfast this morning.

As soon as I stepped out into the guesthouse hallway, I heard footsteps approaching quickly from the other side.

"Oh, Lady Seomun, good morning. Have you eaten? The weather is really nice."

"Huh."

R1o1RUY1V2dWdFByellBWDZwUWJGYUZ6OWs5N0FwNWJlODlMcExkMDgxRlhLY1RzSWZjUWFDSDBVVCttdGQ5SA

It was an unusually dark morning today.

To the human hearing, the sound of rain falling is whoosh, it seems like spring rain is falling quite a bit.

Is the weather nice…?

No, more than that.

"What, Mr. Kim, didn't you go home?"

"Ahem, well, I can't bear to leave my sick friend behind. Are you feeling better?"

Hey, Qing, this kid, he didn't have any friends.

When a person who had no friends makes a friend, there are two main reactions.

Or, you might be afraid of being hated and be afraid to hide your body.

Or it might stick to you and wag its tail as if it's going to take out your liver and gallbladder.

Qing is a humanoid belonging to the former.

It was already several years ago, when I first met and played with Jade Kirin in Luoyang, that we parted ways, saying we would meet again later. I felt that I would cause trouble because of what I did, so we parted ways right away.

But what about those who fall into the latter category?

We're so stuck together that we don't even think about leaving, so what are you doing today? What are you going to do tomorrow? Where are you going the day after tomorrow? Aren't we friends?

Of course, these characters are not bad.

He is truly loyal, devoted, and unchanging, a friend you can truly say you will spend your entire life with and grow old together with.

This type of person is the type of person who ruins their life by making bad friends because they are so easy to fool.

Instead, a little, somewhat, slightly, um, annoying… … .

But what.

Well, how long will it take?

The reason he clings to me is because I'm his only friend, and it's even more so because it doesn't seem like he'll have any other friends in the future.

Now that we've dispersed the Black Tortoise and eliminated the cause of her ugliness, what if we add the Taeeumoknyeo Shingong? Ultimately, this is the birth of Seol Ga-ryeon's second, Kim Ga-ryeon.

Then you will naturally make more friends.

Well, I feel guilty for bothering someone who was living quietly on their own, and I did receive some lifesaving help, so I'll just hang out with them until then.

Since I don't really have a place to call home, I think it'll probably just follow me.

Well, if you miss your hometown, you can return to Joseon, but if not, it wouldn't be a bad idea to introduce you to Seolga Sanghoe...

I have to keep going to the wedding, but I feel bored lying down because of my pelvis.

So, Kim's observation log!

[Kim's first day of observation.]

Humpbacked, no, now that I've removed the iceberg, I've avoided being a hunchback, so I'm just an ugly hunchback, an ugly man!

Well, somehow, I was okay with the ugly guy, but I felt guilty about the ugly guy, and it felt like I was having some really bad thoughts?

Of course, that's not necessary.

If we're not friends, it would be rude to say, "This kid is really ugly."

What if we are friends?

It wasn't rude at all.

Rather, since we are friends, it was necessary to face reality objectively, so now there is no need to feel guilty about calling him ugly.

anyway.

It's not that I'm sick, but in my opinion as a medical professional, a pelvic fracture is actually a deep trauma that is considered quite serious.

Because the pelvis is the center of the body that is stimulated by all human actions.

Every action causes pain, making it difficult to continue with daily life, let alone work. Furthermore, the continued stress does not heal well.

Human bones are roughly healed in about two months, so there is no problem with work or daily life, but it takes about six months for bones to fully heal.

Of course, who is this body? A master who transcends the realm.

Since the injury heals three times faster and there is no further damage, it will probably take about two weeks to fully recover and feel healthy without worrying about inflammation.

However, until then, it is a situation where you need to recuperate.

So, the soldiers who sold the carts were lying on the beds placed on the carts, but the ride on the cart was still shaky even with the beds placed on it.

Anyway, I received a lot of help from Kim in this part.

Since the back of the cart is lifted, the horse pulls the front and the person lifts the back, wouldn't the ride be surprisingly smooth?

Enough to be able to sleep all day.

However, it is a pity that it is a bit biased to one side, as Kim's side is too low...

Kim's head was originally quite low, so he had to bend over to support the iceberg attached to his back.

I thought so, but even when I straightened my back, my height didn't increase much.

When standing together, in a situation where you have to lower your head and look down, you can clearly see the empty, gray crown of your head. Oh my, it can't be that sad...

[Kim's fifth day of observation.]

Amazing news!

Kim's crown is turning gray!

The barren crown of his head, which had seemed to be clinging to a bit of wet thread, was beginning to grow densely with black hair.

Is this the miracle of a desert becoming a forest?

According to Kim's one-sided claim, from a vague memory from his childhood, his biological father and grandfather's hair was so thick that a fine-toothed comb could not go through it.

It is said that it resembles a black tortoise and has fallen.

Well, it's only been three days since I built up the Taeeumoknyeo Shingong, so I don't think it will have a dramatic effect yet.

[Kim's observation, tenth day.]

Kim's skin is gradually healing.

The expression "Amunda" is a bit strange, but I guess there's no other way to express it, because it was such a mess.

The skin that had been cracked and split like a turtle's has quickly become chapped and now only the cracked marks remain.

At the same time, the chin that had been protruding forward was slightly retracted, and the eyebrow bone that was high like a rugged mountain was subtly sinking.

It is truly amazing how the appearance of a turtle gradually changed into that of a human.

[Kim's fifteenth day of observation.]

Today I arrived in a city called Donghua.

Yes, it's a city. A place where civilization exists.

It's been a long time since I've seen a city, with sleek buildings stretching out as far as the eye can see, and streets bustling with what could be called crowds.

The moment she entered the city, a crowd of people welcomed the new mistress of Manchuria, and the cheers of countless spectators poured out like enthusiastic cheers.

Of course, it was impossible to know whether they had been mobilized by force or had walked out voluntarily.

Now that I can walk and run without any pain, I was able to avoid the tragedy of being carried on a half-rickshaw, half-horse, and bed-ridden stretcher through the welcoming crowd.

I asked Captain Pori when the wedding would be held, and he said, oh no, we have to wait another two weeks.

Now that I think about it, that's true. A wedding isn't something you just throw away and end, so there's bound to be a lot of preparations to make.

Mr. Kim is gradually regaining his human form.

The days of being called ugly may not be far off... ... What? Hmm, this kid, this, I'm not sure yet.

[Kim's twenty-fifth day of observation.]

It's certain now.

A huge twist! A huge feast!

Mr. Kim is an ugly man. He is an ugly man.

Many people have returned from monsters to humans?

If you look at the eyes, nose, and mouth individually, they are truly ugly, and if you combine them, the synergistic effect of each part makes them even uglier.

Yes, he was an ugly man from the beginning!

I just went from being a monster to being human.

It's a bad idea, but then, was there really a reason to hate and blame Hyunmumu?

Although the teacher was a very bastard, he probably didn't feel too guilty even though his student's appearance was distorted.

It's like an honorable death, so to speak.

Even if he were left alone, he would have been an ugly man who could have aimed for the best in the world, but he got twisted into an ugly man because he learned the Black Tortoise as an attribute. Something like that.

But I still believe in the Taeeumoknyeo Shingong.

Look at the snowdrops.

This is the world's greatest miracle that transformed the heavy-looking man with a sharp jaw and prominent temples, Seol Ga-nom, into a gorgeous and beautiful woman.

When I think about it that way, I feel like I have done you a truly great favor.

Well, of course.

----

On the day of the wedding.

The shaman said it was an auspicious day, but the weather was so clear and sunny without a single cloud that I wondered if it was really a supernatural power.

But then again, isn't this a pseudo-world where real witchcraft exists?

At noon, the groom, the chieftain of the Jurchen tribe, will set out on a magnificently decorated horse to fetch his bride.

But, there was something I had to do before that.

This peace process is not a procedure to send the princess to a foreign country, that is, to the leader of barbarians.

It was a marriage between the great general in charge of the northern part of the Zhongyuan and the most precious woman of the heavenly descendants!

So, the groom who was supposed to go and receive the bride had to be a great general of the Zhongyuan, not a chieftain of the Jurchen tribe.

The Grand General's award ceremony must be held before the wedding.

Who will give the award?

Originally, the job of imperial envoy was that of eunuchs.

An altar built on the ground signifies a higher position. How could a eunuch climb up to a higher platform where the Heavenly Son resides?

If you're going to be like that, you shouldn't have been born as the emperor's daughter!

So, Qing stood on the stage.

It was a platform with two steps stacked on top of each other.

The three-tiered platform symbolizes the Emperor, and the two-tiered platform one level lower is for the Emperor's grandson and the prince.

And there were also those who could write on the two steps: the emperor's orders, the heavenly mandate, the earthly representatives, the imperial envoys, who were also qualified to stand on the two steps.

He wore a blue robe with a gold belt, and placed two large incense burners in front of him, burning smoke, showing the majesty of the imperial envoy.

So, outside the city's south gate, thousands of people kneel before the platform, their backs straight, and watch the Qing.

What does it look like to you?

The whole city was gathered together, kneeling and looking at me, it was a truly amazing sight, the kind I thought I would never experience in my life.


CHAPTER 946

Ding… … ! Ding… … ! Ding… … !

The drummer strikes the drum three times.

Then, the old eunuch standing in front of the stage took a deep breath and shouted in a stern voice that was impossible to imagine with his usual stern speech.

"The Emperor who received the Mandate of Heaven speaks."

He paused for a beat and then made a sound-

"The peace of the country is due to the merit of the general.

Among them, the military duty of guarding the borders of a country is the most dangerous and important duty.

We must find a hero who is strong, courageous, and has outstanding strategy and trust him with that.

The Jurchen man Noi Hap-jeok is renowned throughout the world for his loyalty and courage.

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTdzE5d3lBVUJ0ZGQxcDRDbFFnQmpMTThDMWJjUURxMUJkMjRoR3YyL1ppeQ

Jim admires his talent and appoints him as the General of the North, putting him in command of all the troops.

Command the troops of the North, give orders fairly, govern the army, and bring comfort to the people.

All the generals of the north must obey his commands and not disobey them.

Then the man kneeling in front raises both arms high and shouts.

"I will uphold the mandate of heaven! Long live! Long live! Long live!"

If Qing had studied physiognomy in this era, he might have noticed that the man's face was truly that of a fool.

What is a Nango statue?

You must have exclaimed, "What a traitor's physiognomy! He'll strike you in the back and stab you in the back as soon as he shows any opening!"

But how could Qing know real physiognomy?

The man bowed deeply four times in a row.

And in the fifth bow, he suddenly stretched out his arms and supported his upper body, bowing his head three times as if he were doing push-ups while kneeling.

The act of lowering one's head while lying face down was a Zhongyuan etiquette called Godurye.

Bowing five times and bowing three times is a ritual for the emperor.

"The Emperor who received the mandate of heaven speaks."

"Therefore, I hereby bestow upon you the General's flag and a bundle of treasures, as a testament to your honorable appointment.

This is the will of the Lord, and the command of Heaven.

"My people, obey my will."

As Qing said this, the man jumped up from his seat and climbed onto the stage.

So the man knelt before the Qing, for the general could rise to the same height as the emperor when he received the moon.

The military was the most important matter for the country, and when going to war, it meant that the soldiers would serve the general as if he were the emperor.

This was the reason why becoming a general was sometimes expressed as climbing the ladder to the throne.

Behind the blue, the guard passes the moon.

Since Buwol is a combination of the words dok-ak-bu and dok-ak-wol, it should obviously be an axe, but when I look at it, hmm. This doesn't seem to be an axe.

A shovel, isn't it? It's a shovel, too.

Because the blade is not attached horizontally to the end of the red-painted axe handle, but is attached upwards like a spear and protrudes in the direction of the handle.

No matter how I looked at it, it seemed like there was no way to chop it, but it was obvious that it wasn't something that could be used in actual combat.

The axe blade is made of shiny gold, and the part that connects to the axe handle is made of carved jade, making it a pretty ornament that looks like it might shatter if dropped.

Anyway.

When Qing hands over the Buwol, the man, Noihapjeok, the chieftain of the Aesin Gakra tribe, raises both hands and respectfully accepts it.

How do you pronounce a man's name in the Yeojin way?

The historic moment when Aisin Gioro Nurhachi bowed to the Emperor of the Zhongyuan and was appointed as the Great General of the North!

Of course, Qing has no feelings at all.

Oh, Nurhachi? Aisin Gioro Nurhachi? That's ten characters? That's a peculiar name. It'll be hard to pronounce...

It's not that Qing is ignorant, but it's just useless trivia that's of no use to him even if he were to find out about it in the first place.

----

In the traditional wedding of the Jurchen people, or more precisely, the Jin Dynasty, only the groom is busy.

The wedding took place outdoors, and the bride and her family watched from the living room, looking down on him.

So, Qing was sitting in the living room with the bride, watching the banquet. Why on earth? I thought they were guests, but they were the bride's family?

However, the two are family.

Even though he knew that the fake marriage was fake, he acknowledged it as a marriage and sent a peace treaty. This was a long-standing tradition in the Zhongyuan of 'sending a peace treaty after adopting a daughter.'

And the real Yeonsul is no longer a princess, but only Seomuncheonhwa, the former Yeonsul inspector.

However, since they are the current princess and the former princess, they are not blood related, but they are family.

Qing looks outside with envious eyes in an awkward atmosphere.

The guests sit in the courtyard and enjoy food and drinks, while the groom is busy walking around and filling their glasses.

Alcohol is not something you drink indiscriminately, but something you have to share. The groom has to fill each guest's glass three times before moving on to the next part.

Well, I know how to drink too.

Why isn't there any alcohol here? Shouldn't there be alcohol in the bridal waiting room, too? Isn't the bride not allowed to drink? Doesn't the bride's friend next to her drink?

Neither the bride nor the groom drinks, so it might sound a bit crazy to say it out loud.

"Ximen Inspector."

Yeonsul quietly calls out to Qing.

"yes?"

"Could you please show me your face? They say your beauty is so beautiful that you could rival the most beautiful in the world."

Well, I guess the princess is bored too. Of course she is.

He lifts up his cotton thread.

He looks at Yeonsul blankly.

And then, I too will reveal my face by lifting the cotton thread.

The exposed face and neck are covered in mottled patches, and there are countless marks that look like they were pressed by a blunt needle, which are called pockmarks.

Still, her face was definitely beautiful, and her beauty was evident.

If it weren't for the condition of her skin, she would have been renowned as one of the most beautiful women in the world.

"What do you think, do we look alike?"

"Uh, um."

"Why, is it so hard to tell with your skin like this? If you put on some powder, it'll be pretty similar. And what if you cover your face? Carrying something so big and heavy makes my shoulders ache every day. Isn't that the same for you?"

"Certainly, it is uncomfortable."

"Yeah, that's right. Is it just your shoulders that hurt? They're always sticky with sweat down there. In the summer, it's hot and sweaty, and in the winter, you wear layers, so they sweat too. And that's not all? Since you can't see down there, stubbing your toes is a regular occurrence. And if you spill food, it drips all over your front pockets, so it's always a mess. And is it comfortable to sleep on? If you lie down, it's pressed and painful, and if you lie on your side, it's uncomfortable because it's pushed out. If you lie up, isn't it hard to breathe?"

Suddenly, it's time for a big breasted burial.

However, I don't have much sympathy for Qing.

I think it was like that in the early to mid-first year of my martial arts career, but since I was already at the peak of my martial arts career in my second year, it's okay to carry some weight around.

The only thing that makes you sweat is that the sweat that comes out because it's hot almost disappears as you become a pro, but even so, the sweat that naturally comes out because your flesh is pressed against flesh is something else...

But since it was like that in the past, I am more than qualified to hit the gong.

Besides, I'm an expert in this situation, so it's not uncomfortable, but you should be an expert too, Princess. I can't just answer by saying you're an expert, right?

Regardless of the difference in status, this is something only a sleazy, clueless kid would say.

So, let's play the Qingdo janggu.

"Well, well. Ah, there are more than a few times when I just want to throw it away. Ah, isn't it okay to be a master? You wouldn't say that if you had your heart cut off. It's so painful that you can't even speak, but this is also a weakness, a weakness."

Yeonsul covers her mouth and says, "Oh my."

"Yes. That's right. But no matter how uncomfortable it may be, I'm truly grateful to have been born this way. Thanks to that."

Yeonsul smiled slightly and continued speaking-

"Thanks to you, I, a lowly being, am living a life of such honor. Mama."

"yes?"

"Because I was born in a humble state, I know a little about how to win your heart. This is my talent for eavesdropping on the conversations going on in the palace."

Shocking! Yeonsul knew Qing's true identity from the beginning!

Well, it's not really that shocking, but whatever.

Qing scratched the back of his head embarrassedly.

"Ah. So you knew……."

"I wanted to thank you. But please forgive my petty pretense of not noticing, out of fear that you might hate me."

"Hey, no. And what else is there to be thankful for? You did the work I didn't want to do, so I should be grateful."

Then Yeonsul's lips curved gently.

"I've always wondered. What kind of person is Your Majesty that there's no one in the palace who doesn't love You? I once thought, "I was born a noble person, and I only receive love, so the world must be truly cruel." But now I finally understand."

Yeonsul holds Qing's hand tightly.

Sometimes, one action speaks louder than a hundred words.

Just holding hands like that without saying a word.

How much time has passed like that?

Finally, the wedding ceremony comes to an end.

It was the groom's turn to kneel in the yard in front of the room where the bride was sitting and shout loudly.

"Man is more humble than woman, and woman is more noble than man! Therefore, O noble one, show mercy to this lowly being!"

At that, the guests burst into laughter.

I heard that it was a truly traditional wedding that is rarely done these days, a wedding ceremony from the Jin Dynasty, a long time ago during the Jurchen Dynasty.

Well, Master should have seen this.

It is said that in the past there was a country called the Jin Dynasty.

Of course, if Seomunsurin heard that, he would click his tongue and say, "Those Jin barbarian bastards are the kind of guys who take over their mothers when their fathers die and marry them. Since the time when Seoshi made peace, a biological son cannot inherit his biological mother, but in any case, women are treated as property of their fathers."

But if he were to leave with the consciousness he had, he would have said that the men of the Zhongyuan would be no different and would have given a long speech about how to treat the women of the Zhongyuan.

After that, there should be a time for the bride's family to say good-bye words, usually from the father-in-law.

The master is over there in the Forbidden City, and he has sent a representative down in his stead, so who should give the sermon?

Qing sits awkwardly and looks at Aesin Gakra.

Originally, it was a place to hear words of wisdom from the elders of the bride's side, but since there were no other elders, Qing was left alone in the separate room.

Is this how you lured me? The old eunuch sold me out, ugh, let's just wait and see... ...!

"First of all, congratulations. And also, I hope you have a happy married life…? I hope you live well?"

"thank you."

"hmm."

I don't know if I'd ever gotten married before entering the martial arts world, but I should know something about it.

And even if I knew, what would I do? Why would I talk about something I already know here? If different people want to live together, they have to compromise and keep the line, so there's no way they'll make concessions to each other.

It was a time when Qing awkwardly blinked her eyes.

"Let me introduce myself again. My name is Aesin Gakra Noihapjeok. Madam?"

"Oh, it's called Ximen Qing."

The old man tilted his head in puzzlement.

"Qing, Qing, somehow it feels familiar, it rolls off my tongue. Hmm, what a wonderful name. Truly, truly a wonderful name. I don't know why, but it just rolls off my tongue. Qing, clear and blue; Qing, vivid and bright; Qing, Qing, how perfect is this name, worthy of being called the Mandate of Heaven of any dynasty…?"

At that, Qing got goosebumps.

What the heck, why are you using someone else's name? Is this, like, a taunt? Is this something a groom should say when meeting the bride's family?

"Oh, I apologize. I didn't mean to offend you, but somehow, the moment you hear it, you're immediately surprised and can't help but exclaim in awe."

Is there anything so surprising about someone else's name?

Well, anyway, I know it's rude, so let's just ignore it.

"I heard that you are a close associate of the Emperor and a famous confidant. Is that correct?"

"No? This is the first time I've heard of it either."

"Are you saying that's not true? I heard you're the one who can communicate directly with the Emperor."

"Oh, that's true."

"……?"

Usually, such a person is called a confidant.

Noihapjeok, who had been puzzled for a moment, now had a serious expression on his face.

"So, I would like to confess this now."

A wrinkle formed between Qing's eyebrows.

No, this kid-

"Actually, I received a proposal from someone who calls himself the Supreme Demon King."

"Are you talking about Shiksimma?"

"Yes, Siksimma said he would help rebuild the Jin Dynasty. This is a long-cherished wish of our people. How could I refuse such an offer?"

He looks into Noihapjeok's eyes.

What the heck, a trap? Are you suggesting a fight?

"Of course, it wasn't a proposal I could simply accept. How could we rebuild our dynasty now that the Zhongyuan are so powerful? So, I asked you to prove the strength of your blood sect. He promised to attack and destroy it before the peace treaty reached this land."

"……You knew about the attack?"

"It was a matter of one nation submitting to another, so as a chieftain, I needed certainty. If the Zhongyuan were strong enough, they would easily repel attacks like this. Conversely, if the Zhongyuan couldn't even stop the attacks of a single cultist, then there would be no reason for us to join the Zhongyuan."

Suddenly, Captain Pori's words flash through my mind.

He expressed his gratitude for luring and defeating the Shiksim Demon, saying, 'We are well aware of Shiksim Demon's abilities.'

I didn't think much of it at the time, but now that I think about it, the skills of Shikshimma were unknown even to the martial arts world of the Zhongyuan. If I had known, I would have changed the list of the top ten martial artists in the world right away.

There was no way the Jurchen cavalry would have known about the power of such a sage.

"Wait a minute, there were a lot of people injured in the sales."

"I'm deeply grateful to you for that. Even though peace had already reached this land, I never expected such an attack. Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a major disaster."

Noihapjeok bowed and showed his crown, showing a very polite attitude.

But, um, did you really not know?

Even if they were welcoming a peace procession, I wondered if the reason they sent a guard composed of only the most elite members of the best armed forces was just to show off.

"I confess now. Aren't we in the same boat as you, General? The Blood Cult might exploit this later, so I'm telling you in advance. However, simply confessing won't be enough to erase the fact that we even briefly attempted to negotiate a deal, even with our loss."

It was quite a shameless thing to say, but Noihapjeok continued speaking confidently.

"Please report to His Majesty. These men have proposed that if the Jin Dynasty were to rise up and wage war, the Northern Yuan would aid them. This is evidence that the Mongolian barbarians are in league with the Blood Cult and a sign that they are once again planning to invade the Zhongyuan. Isn't this sufficient proof?"


CHAPTER 947

The party is over.

After all, there was no reason for a wedding ceremony to last forever. Guests simply wished the bride and groom a happy life and left.

“Hehehe, Your Majesty, you must return to the Zhongyuan now. May I, the old slave, take you there?”

The old eunuch's hoarse voice was laced with a hint of charm, causing Qing to rub the goosebumps that were rising on her own.

It may be rude to say the least, but in fact, besides Cheong, Kim Heo-jung next to him, and the eunuch next to the Golden Guard also had the same expression.

Moreover, eunuchs tend to enjoy this kind of reaction in the first place, so that is probably why the old eunuch has a somewhat satisfied smile.

Anyway, the eunuch is too burdensome to return with, and although it may be a bit illogical now, I still don't want to get involved with the palace any further.

So, Qing smiles awkwardly and hands over a sealed envelope.

"Well, it's unfortunate, but we have to stop along the way, and the process of entering the Forbidden City is cumbersome. However, I've written a letter of recommendation. Would you please present it to me, Your Majesty?"

Seogye refers to a mission report, which is a report written down the results of a mission received by a subject.

Since Qing is an inspector of the twelve provinces, he will be the inspector general who can directly reach the emperor.

So, Seomuncheonhwa, the royal inspector and princess, entrusted this important document to him and said:

“Well, it’s more important than you think, so could you please try to get it done on time?”

What Qing meant by 'not too late' was that there was no need to rush since the eunuch would return to the Forbidden City anyway, but he also meant that he did not want to be lazy and delay.

R1o1RUY1V2dWdFByellBWDZwUWJGVzNLOSsybm5PMnZuMnVabmFVcEtaUUJkbklQNnBpQ21YNnY4ZGtYRWsvRQ

“Your Majesty, I will humbly heed your words.”

The eunuch accepted it politely and answered in a solemn voice, so it must have had a completely different meaning to the eunuch listening.

Big payout! Delivered as quickly as possible!

It wasn't exactly an exaggerated interpretation of the eunuch.

It's common for a single word from a higher-up to be a bolt from the blue for someone lower down.

So, the eunuch runs.

Riding a fine horse, he abandons his tired horse and runs at full speed.

It was a rapid advance that did not require sleep day or night, so it was only when they reached Liaoning that they took their horses out of the post station and got some sleep on horseback.

The Royal Guards attached to him were on the verge of death from the unexpected all-night march. Still, if this sly eunuch was acting like this, the inspector's influence was no ordinary one. So, for now, it would be better for me to quietly join them.

The three thousand mile road from Donghua to Beijing.

And after ten days had passed.

The Emperor looks down at the sealed royal secretariat.

The expression on the emperor's face as he looked down at the book was unreadable.

Because the place where the great man sits alone on a high dragon's throne is structured so that brilliant sunlight pours down behind him and illuminates the whole palace.

Because a face with its back to the sun and backlit is not visible in the shadows.

Of course, even without that, who in the world would dare to gaze upon the face of the Emperor? So, a face that no one dares to gaze upon anyway, whether it's shadowed or not, makes little difference.

If so, who would notice that the one sitting on the throne was not the Emperor himself, but a mere substitute? Even if they did notice, who would dare to come forward and point it out?

So then, is the emperor really necessary?

however.

If someone unqualified to sit on the throne, the whole world will be filled with war, blood and pus will overflow, and screams will rage.

The Emperor uses the authority bestowed by Heaven to suppress the chaos of the world and bring peace.

So, the emperor was the heaviest weight in the world, or the person wearing the heaviest chains.

And so it was with the Emperor's blood relatives.

That is why the Emperor's feelings when looking at the West World are extremely complicated.

He released the princess because she would become an unparalleled master in the future and have the ability to bring the martial arts world under his feet.

If they call him back then and reveal that he is a descendant of the emperor, the martial arts world will be subordinated to the imperial family.

What kind of people are these in the martial arts world!

Because the land is vast and the people are numerous, the nobles and warlords who had no choice but to neglect it now privately wield swords in the name of martial arts and wreak havoc on the world.

The task of pacifying this was the royal family's duty and long-cherished wish, and so it would be a wish that the princess, as a member of the royal family, should dedicate her life to accomplishing.

But was the reason for releasing the princess only because of this duty and political strategy with the world in mind?

She was a princess who had already escaped the shackles of the Heavenly Son through death. Her true nature remained intact, so she seemed to be living well outside the palace.

Perhaps it was the heart of a father, not an emperor, who did not want to imprison the princess, who had been freed from her chains, in the palace again.

So, while the Emperor must be truly pleased and happy to receive the royal inspector's report, as a father, it must be extremely regrettable and sad.

Of course, the emperor's expression was unknown.

The sun in the sky was so dazzling that it cast a backlight, and the authority that weighed down on the heads of the subjects.

So, the emperor spreads out the book of scriptures.

In that moment, the emperor's eyes opened wide.

The eyes of the man who should never lose his composure at any moment trembled slightly. Was the content of the book really that shocking?

“Huh.”

Even at the same time, some emotions that could not be held back leaked out as moans.

It was a moment when the nerves of the courtiers in Daejeon were on edge.

Whether it was so or not, the emperor looked at the sealed letter with wavering eyes and thought to himself.

What the heck, what is this writing?

The writing is neat and easy to read, and is neat and elegant, never messy.

Yet, the letters fill the space, making it grand and heavy, the strength of the strokes as solid as steel, and the balance that does not lean to any one side, making it a font that truly reigns supreme like Mount Tai.

And what is this curve!

Each stroke of this magnificent writing is not straight, forming a subtle curve. This is the law of life in nature, where nothing is straight.

The morality and moderation are magnificent, but the parts are so vibrant and writhing like nature, it is as if the world itself has been engraved in writing!

The emperor's handwriting was so magnificent that the content was barely noticeable.

As if entranced, I licked the letter for a long time, examining the parts of the eight-legged method, examining the horizontal and vertical strokes, and was overwhelmed by the ridges and grooves that resembled the Taesan Mountain, feeling the weight of the impression and gazing at the majestic, flowing curves for a long time.

Even each stroke changes its shape most naturally in its own place, which is the trace of a master who completed it a long time ago.

The Emperor's work is through words and writing, so how can he come to his senses when he sees this sudden, outrageous calligraphy?

Thanks to that, it was only after a considerable amount of time that the content of the article finally caught my eye.

[Long live the Emperor, the Emperor of Manan, the Inspector General, the Emperor of Manan ...

"Your Majesty, may you live long and be in peace. The royal inspector presents this letter to the Emperor."

The old enemies of the north, the energy of the North Road, have risen again, and various tribes have secretly united, and they have also accepted a cult called the Blood Cult, and are rapidly growing in power.

As a sign of this, the northern route's forces, calling themselves emissaries to the Northern General, are plotting a cunning plot to invade the Zhongyuan. The time of their invasion is imminent...

The emperor's gaze gradually becomes indifferent.

The word "Jungwon" means empire, but also means the center of the world.

And it is impossible for a great empire at the center of the world to be weak, especially when it comes to the barbarians on the borders, given how the Zhongyuan served as a huge wall to block them.

The weak barbarians grew in power through tribute, so countless barbarian forces arose in the border regions and were in disarray among themselves, unable to look down on the Zhongyuan.

Then, when the barbarians grow, they are immediately crushed by sending troops, so that the barbarians are always small and prolific, and they are weeded out so that they cannot dare to look down on the great nation.

So, naturally, they also worked hard to accumulate intelligence on the barbarians.

The suspicious behavior of the Mongol barbarians had already been detected and was being closely watched.

This reconciliation trip was proof of that.

Those thugs, the Mongol barbarians, were acting suspiciously, so I raised the Jurchen and appointed them generals.

The Jurchen chieftain may have thought that he had unified the tribes through his own ability, but this growth was possible because the Zhongyuan had previously turned a blind eye to the unification of Manchuria.

But, a blood sect?

It's not that socialites are scary.

However, since we have not yet received any information that the Mongolian barbarians were in collusion with the Blood Cult, if this were true, wouldn't the trust in the intelligence we have built up so far be shaken to the ground?

Then the emperor gestured to the eunuch, the chief of the eunuchs, who was standing with his hands folded respectfully under the stone steps, and handed him a letter and sent it down.

Then, the eunuch who came down to Daejeon cleared his throat and opened the book, saying in a loud voice-

“…….”

“…….”

“……?”

The subjects steal glances at the eunuch.

A eunuch with his face painted over, his mouth gaping open, his eyes wide open, and only his pupils painted.

How shocking must the contents of the book be that even the most experienced eunuch dare not open his mouth!

Well, it's a problem with the writing itself rather than the content.

Oh my, how could such writing exist! How could such writing exist, and how could the writing of such a master remain unknown? It is truly magnificent (omitted).

It seems like it will take a little more time before the meeting begins… … .

----

April 1st.

Even in the northern land of Liaoning, spring blooms in April.

The earth, as if it had never been like that, is covered with fresh greenery, and the sunlight is warm and tickles the skin.

In the open fields, farmers bend and straighten their backs and sing about their hard work, so wherever you go, the cheerful tune fills your ears.

Dig through the water in the field and plant the seedlings.

The spring weather is beautiful and my heart is even happier.

Lala-dung, lala-dung, spring has finally come.

It is human nature to feel excited at this time of year.

It is the season when tourists who have been cooped up all winter come out because the weather is nice.

The streets were teeming with people, black hair, the sound of people shouting to attract customers, voices raised somewhere in arguments big and small, and crowds gathered in a circle as if there was something to see.

As each guesthouse was filled with guests, the room, filled with the fragrance of wine from broad daylight, was filled with countless chatter, people reminiscing about the winter they couldn't bear to hear. Since it was hard to hear, everyone gradually raised their voices until they were at the level of shouting.

Among them, there is a table piled high with dishes.

At the large table where ten people can sit, the plates are stacked one on top of the other, so it seems like the amount is too much for ten people to eat.

The feeling of looking at him is refreshing.

Wasn't it exactly the fourth month of spring when I suddenly opened my eyes in an unfamiliar cave?

Since then, the first day of April has been a special anniversary for Qing, the seventh anniversary!

Wow, it's already been seven years?

I feel like time really flies, but when I think about it, I also feel like a lot has happened in the meantime.

It still feels like yesterday, the first time we celebrated our anniversary, the day we ordered tangsuyuk.

Now that I think about it, it was a simple dish that I couldn't even call a meal, but at the time, I really had to make a big decision to order it, but it fell out so suddenly that I couldn't even eat a single bite.

Um, what was his name, um, what was it? Well, it's not really important, it's just that something like that happened.

When I think back on those times, isn't it truly a luxury?

The money in the pangs is so generous that it's overflowing when you think of the receipts, so there's no need to worry about counting the money you don't have, so the table is truly a feast.

furthermore.

“Young Lady, you look unusually cheerful today. Is something good happening?”

“……? Sister, you’re always in a good mood as long as you have something to eat?”

“No, it’s a little different than usual.”

The Mo Yong siblings whisper, and on the other side, Kim gulps.

Above all, I wasn't celebrating alone or shaking, so this is luxury.

"Okay, that's enough. Let's eat first. Today, we have to start with sweet and sour soup."

Qing giggles and stretches out his hand, snatching the leg of fried chicken lying there, its golden skin glistening and tempting.

Chopsticks are good, but chicken legs are best eaten with your hands.

As you casually pull on the chicken leg, a complete leg and thigh naturally emerge.

In fact, this is a truly amazing feat.

Although it is called fried chicken, tangsuyukye is a dish in which only the skin is fried after boiling it and pouring oil over it.

A well-cooked chicken that is tender and juicy will just fall out when you pull on it, so the sight of him gently pulling on it with one hand and holding the whole leg was truly a remarkable feat.

This is a move that contains the profound principle of martial arts, the principle of bringing out gentleness through strength.

If a master sees this, he might wonder why he would go to such lengths to just remove a chicken leg.

But chicken legs are a serious matter.

The chicken fat dripping down the well-cooked thigh meat made Qing's mouth water.

If you put it in your mouth and chew it, wow, the crispy skin fried in salty oil and the juicy, soft meat inside will surely melt away, and Qing's eyes will draw a pretty curve without him knowing and his mouth will open wide-

That was the moment.

Whack! Whack! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The sounds of breaking, the crash of something heavy falling, the loud noise of tables and the like being toppled over, the sharp shards of plates shattering… … .

In the meantime, Qing blinks.

The mushy, well-cooked chicken leg, unable to withstand the shock, stopped dead in its tracks, leaving only the bones hanging limply, just as it was about to sink under the noodles.


CHAPTER 948

Suddenly, time passes slowly.

A villain who fell through the ceiling.

Then he throws himself down, trampling on the table.

The table snapped! Half of it snapped and bounced back violently.

So what about the dishes on the table?

Roasted duck slowly soaring in all directions, Dongpo pork waving in waves, red and white broths rising like angry waves scattering and intersecting in all directions, and cut bok choy and cabbage weaving in between.

Qing's pupils narrow, a look of shock appears on his face, and at the same time, boundless sorrow appears.

No, my food, my cooking, no… …!

Some might say this:

How can a warrior who has reached the highest level not stop an uninvited guest from falling from above?

But Qing feels wronged. It feels like her heart is crumbling. No, it has already crumbled.

No, it's Hwagyeong and Nabal.

I was just having a normal meal, but it was suspicious at first glance, so I wouldn't have noticed if it was a secluded inn, but it was a high-class inn in a city where basic public safety was maintained.

Or, it's not like you're being chased by a specific person or group and have to worry about being attacked at every moment.

But here too, do I have to eat while looking around tensely, worried that someone might fall through the ceiling?

Still, sad is sad, and you have to do what you have to do, you two bastards... … .

Qing waves her hand with a sad expression.

Long, white fingers stretch out towards the sky and suddenly grab the person's ankle and pull it.

Crunch!

“Whew!”

With a croak like a crushed frog, the table-wrecker sprang to his feet.

A young man who seemed to be in his mid-twenties. He looked kind and harmless, but he trampled on the table filled with the hopes and dreams of a group of people.

The way the ankle he was holding was twitching in his hand was not ordinary, as if he had some kind of talent for martial arts.

Swish. The tip of the sword touched the villain's Adam's apple.

Looking up along the sword, I saw a woman with a disheveled outfit, a headband of meat and a hostess attached to her head, and a dish of food properly turned over, Murong Zhuxi.

Mo Yong-ju's voice is incredibly eerie.

“Shall I kill you, my lady?”

"Hold on, no. Should I just kill him? Looking at him, I can tell he's not a good guy anyway."

Qing makes a sound of worry.

The young man shouted in horror.

“Wait, wait, there’s a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding!”

"Misunderstanding? What's the point of overturning someone else's table? Or did the table get so startled that it flipped over on its own?"

“There are circumstances here, there are circumstances for everything-”

-Over there! Over there!

A shout cuts off the young man's words, and a group of footsteps, some rather vicious-looking warriors, rush towards him.

At that moment, Mo Yong-jun's eyes sparkle.

Murong Jun was a martial artist. He had run away from home a few times with permission, but those were not the misdeeds of Murong Jun, but of the young master Murong Jun.

This was his first time in the martial arts world, so Mo Yong-jun's eyes sparkled and his heart pounded at the sudden commotion. This was the commotion at the guest house that he had only heard about in stories!

Mo Yong-jun looks back and forth between the kind face of the subdued young man and the ferocious expressions of the approaching warriors.

What could be the young man's story? He tried to dismantle that group, but was overwhelmed, and decided to try again later, breaking the ground and fleeing? He might harbor some kind of grudge against them. Perhaps it's the enmity of his parents, his lover, or perhaps even his master or monk...

If I had to guess, I would say that it would be something that only a kid who grew up listening to martial arts stories would imagine.

However, it is true that Mo Yong-jun was a child and grew up hearing only stories about martial arts from his family.

So, while Mo Yong-jun drew his sword and had a serious and solemn expression on his face-

Wouldn't the men with fierce expressions who had rushed down with great momentum have stood there, at a loss, when they saw the subdued young man?

And then they look at each other and give each other hints at the same time, as if to say, "Someone should go and talk to them."

Well, I guess so.

Cheong-i sighed briefly, let go of the ankle she was holding, stepped forward, tapped Mo-yong-jun on the shoulder, and told him to put away his sword.

“Yes? Why?”

"I'll explain later. Ahem, it seems you're all looking for this author. But we also have a bad relationship with him that needs to be resolved."

Qing says this and spreads her arms.

Look at the mess of seasoning, soup, and other ingredients that were drenched in white robes.

Here, with the table broken and fallen behind and the floor in chaos, it was not difficult to understand what the ill fate Qing was talking about was.

“However, this person seems to be causing trouble in many ways. Could you please hear about your circumstances as well?”

Then the men look at each other, and soon one of them steps forward and politely takes the lottery ticket.

“We are the unmanned people of Nanyangak.”

Nangyagak is a general term for a group of people who connect people seeking work with requests and take a commission.

In other words, the phrase "I am a swordsman" in Nanyangak is a somewhat noble expression for "I am a swordsman."

The word 'Maegeomja' means someone who sells swords, so you could say that he is just a ronin.

There are levels of ronin, so those who proudly declare, "I am a ronin," are actually just skilled people who haven't settled down.

So, even if I try to be a ronin and sell the swordsman of Nanyagak, I will only be laughed at.

“Actually, I was working the night shift and was thinking of having a drink after work……”

The so-called "seller" is a low-level person who lives from hand to mouth and dreams of becoming a top-class expert someday.

For those who are like that, such a high-class guesthouse is a truly burdensome price, so they originally planned to relieve their fatigue by drinking spicy tofu salad and spicy rice wine at a cheap restaurant.

At that moment, a warrior stepped forward confidently, saying, "Don't do that, I'll shoot."

But, you and I are both peddlers, we are all from the lower classes. How can we afford to buy drinks at fancy restaurants?

But surprisingly, his true identity was not that of a swordsman, but rather a disciple of the Cheongryongmun who had set out into the world of martial arts, and it was Pyeonggobon, the son of the sect leader.

Did you believe that?

After all, the Cheongryongmun was widely known as the best sect in this city, Dangsan.

At this point, Qing tilted his head and looked at Murong Zhuxi, implying, "Huh, the Blue Dragon Gate? Do you know anything about it?"

Then, Mo Yong-ju-hee also shook her head and replied, “It’s the first time I’ve heard that name.”

Of course, Murong Zhuxi was a direct descendant of the Murong family, who were renowned throughout the world, so she would not know the names of the small and medium-sized local factions.

And Qing didn't know that originally.

However, since it was a famous sect among the lower classes, these strong sects were originally known to the lower classes better.

To put it in the Qing hometown style, it feels like a big company and a small and medium-sized company, and people working at big companies won't necessarily remember the names of companies that aren't the same big company.

But for those looking for a job right away, the names of promising small and medium-sized companies are also easy to remember.

Anyway.

Surely there wouldn't be a crazy person in Dangsan who would impersonate the Cheongryongmundo, or even the son of the sect leader, so why wouldn't they believe it?

So, the salesmen were very excited and followed him, thinking, "What a blessing, what good luck, what an expensive dish this is!"

however?

“……Suddenly changing his words, saying that there was no reason for him to buy alcohol, he suddenly disappeared through the floor.”

"He even ordered that expensive ghost liquor and drank it all by himself. A bottle of that would have cost a fortune..."

It was an additional explanation from the ronin behind.

Anyway, the ronin who followed me because I said I would buy them drinks, but ended up in trouble, came down in a hurry, and now, like this.

Qing's eyes narrow at him.

No, what is this? What is this?

So, to sum it up.

It turned out that Mr. Pyeong, who worked as a day laborer, was the son of a wealthy family who had come to experience common life.

He said he would buy me food after working hard and took me to a fancy restaurant where each serving was 30,000 won. But after I finished eating, I thought about it and ran away, asking why I had to buy food.

He even ordered the most expensive liquor and drank it all by himself.

Well, if it's trivial, it's trivial, and it's funny, but if you look closely, it's not like that. Why would these day-to-day workers have money to pay for meals at a high-class inn?

It's a comedy when seen from afar, but a tragedy when seen up close.

"So, this kid pretended to be the successor to the Cheongryongmun and riped you off? He betrayed his comrades just to get a fancy meal? This kid deserves the death penalty. He's screwed, really."

Then the ronin shakes his head in sorrow.

“That’s not it.”

“No?”

"That... that person seems to be the successor to the Cheongryongmun. On my way here, several people recognized him, and I even saw the Cheongryongmun bow their heads respectfully. How could that be, unless they were all accomplices?"

Qing turns her head and looks down at the young man.

"What is this? Is this real? This isn't a fake, this is the real thing? The successor to the Blue Dragon Gate?"

"If you understand, please put the sword away first. It's embarrassing to just lie down."

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTeStzQ1RhdnZnUGZpenZ4YjF5TWdzTlVJUEY2dHB1SE95QWZTcmJTNlpqTg

The anxious air from earlier had disappeared without a trace, and the young man, Pyeonggoun, was lying down comfortably, answering calmly.

Qing's expression suddenly turned sour.

No, really? Then what the hell kind of case is this? A chaebol's son preying on day laborers?

“No, why?”

"Oh, there seems to be a misunderstanding. I've been enjoying my journey as a martial artist, hiding my identity, so I don't have any money. My brief visit home seems to have led to this misunderstanding."

"Is that guy coming down through the ceiling just to go home? Maybe he was in such a hurry that he wanted to get back quickly?"

"That's a misunderstanding, too. The floor simply rotted and collapsed on its own. And just because the timing was perfect, it ended up looking like I ran away."

"No, you tried to run away. And you tripped over someone else's head."

"That, too, is a misunderstanding. As you know, being unmanned is a habit that's ingrained in me. I accidentally jumped up, and it just so happened to be over your head. I apologize for that."

Here, the two sides' opinions diverged.

Young man, Pyeonggoun insists that it is all a misunderstanding.

Didn't the ronin complain that Pyeonggoun had planned to take advantage of them?

His blue eyes glared fiercely at him.

Look at this kid?

In fact, if you think about it logically, the young man's words are trustworthy.

From the beginning, I shouted that it was a misunderstanding.

Why would the son of the sect leader, who is said to be doing well, prey on a poor ronin?

Moreover, there is no need to compare the claims of a low-class warrior who is embarrassed to even call himself a ronin with the claims of the son of the head of a famous sect to see which is more credible.

But look at the ronin who came running down.

At first, I ran down the street chasing after the vicious dine-and-dash criminal, but that was all.

In the first place, since he had seen the god destroying the floor of the guesthouse, he probably didn't think he could fight them even if they came rushing in. He probably planned to run away pretending to chase the hit-and-run criminal.

So, when the situation arises where the dine-and-dasher is suddenly subdued, wouldn't they just be looking at each other without being able to say anything and ask for the money?

I knew it just by looking at the shape.

So what's the big deal?

Is it all a misunderstanding? You were trying to bring money?

It's better to come out shamelessly and say, "Yeah, I did that, but what can you do?"

If you emphasize the misunderstanding like this, no matter how much the ronin appeal, who will believe you? Since they already know, you will have no choice but to swallow your anger and endure it.

But, well, I don't really want to kill him.

No, if you want to do something bad, you have to kill someone, steal, or do other bad things that a scoundrel can do.

Why are there all these petty bastards?


CHAPTER 949

Qing's eyes scanned the surroundings.

How could a person from the Zhongyuan refuse to watch a fight? In an age where there is no place to entertain oneself, the always bored Zhongyuan people are said to rush over and even abandon their funerals when they hear the sound of fighting.

So, with the crowds of onlookers flocking in, the Great Wall of China is packed with people everywhere. The walls are densely packed with people.

Inside the cotton swab, the corners of Qing's mouth were crooked. It was exactly the expression known as a rotten smile.

“So, it was all a misunderstanding, and you don’t have any money right now?”

"It's not like the weight of the battlefield makes it hard to see the true nature of the martial world. However, returning home has brought me a surge of excitement. It's embarrassing to just lie down like this, but the sharpness of the blade is unavoidable. It was a situation that could easily have caused misunderstanding, so I apologize to the swordsmen there."

Originally, once a person has developed a bad temper, all of their words and actions become hateful.

I don't know why calling him a swordsman instead of a ronin feels like an apology at all, but is it just my imagination?

“Ahem, well, then the meal fee is…”

The ronin muttered something in his mouth, unable to speak loudly due to the crowd of people.

Even so, the feeling of trailing off and letting out a regretful sound is extremely burdensome for a poor, low-class warrior. I understand that feeling well.

Cheongdo once made a living by beating up bad people and emptying their pockets.

When he was hungry, he would eat grass, and when night fell, he would quietly slip away and sleep under fallen leaves. When he wanted to eat some real human food, he would dip the cheapest dumplings in the soup they gave him for free.

And all the while, I kept counting the coins left in my pocket and wondering how long I could last.

If you don't have money, you become miserable, and once you become miserable, how miserable you become.

Even though Qing's constitution meant he could survive even if thrown into a mountain, he did so.

How important is money to an ordinary criminal who would starve to death without it?

“Jeomsoi! Did you hear? The food prices for the ronin here are, um, no, no.”

Qing quickly changes his words.

Originally, I was going to have the ronin's meal allowance hung on the Cheongryongmun Gate. But? Looking at this bastard, even the Cheongryongmun Gate seems unattractive.

In a group where a guy who preys on poor ronin belongs, would he really give the guesthouse the money for the meal just because it was given to him?

Of course, some might ask why we judge the entire sect based on just one person, and that the deviations of a few do not represent the whole.

But what about those who have only experienced a part of it?

The law of the part representing the whole.

Since I don't know anything about the Cheongryongmun, this little bastard Pyeonggoun, the only Cheongryongmun disciple, can only represent the entire Cheongryongmun.

"No, I'll pay for the ronin's meals. Plus, I'll have to pay for the food and clothes you ruined. Surely you won't refuse, will you?"

"Of course I should compensate you. If you put away the sword, I will stop by the temple right away, collect the money, and return."

bWpnL1VNWWVlR0h2N0IyVWd5ZUJTNmFVZGY4WUhtbFh3QSt5MHVWQ1RXMGJhWnBuWWlBU0wybkwxMUpGd1RCVw

"What are you talking about? How can I trust you and just let you go? We should go together and get it right away."

A slight stiffness appears on his kind-hearted face, which seems to be a good person.

Well, that can't be helped.

Sending someone home and telling them to bring money is a completely different thing than going home with them and getting the money.

In the Qing hometown way, it would be like contacting the family to collect money and openly telling them that this kid didn't pay back the money.

Because it is an act of forcing the truth to be known to those closest to you who do not want to know, not to mention destroying your personal dignity.

It's the same in Qing's hometown.

But even here, in the primitive ancient Zhongyuan, aren't the Zhongyuan people a race that lives and dies for the sake of appearance?

“That, my lady? I am the direct disciple of the Cheongryongmun, and the sect leader is my father.”

Pyeonggoun brings up his position again.

It is a roundabout way of saying that he will give money at the risk of the reputation of the monk and his master.

Of course, it would be a disgrace to both myself and my master to say that I would stake my reputation on the monk and his master over such a trivial matter.

But Qing didn't know the implications. To be precise, she shouldn't have. She pretended not to.

I don't know about that. I'm clueless and my brain is pure, so I guess I'll just have to imitate Heemae.

"I already heard that. But what? So what? Money-related issues should be resolved immediately. Otherwise, you'll just end up hurt and upset for no reason."

“That’s not it.”

"No, why, you said you'd go home and get the money? If we go together, you won't have to go all the way back to the inn, so it'll be convenient. I'll get the money and pay the bill right away, which is nice, and you'll have to go back to the inn to give the money and then go back again, so it'll save you a lot of walking. Wow, this is killing two birds with one stone. It's good for my sister and good for my brother-in-law. I'll give you money and take it. No, that last part was weird, right? What was it? Oh, it's killing two birds with one stone."

Even thinking about it again, it was a perfect imitation of Gyeonpohee.

"Now, stand up. If you do anything reckless, I'll tie you up and take you away. I don't know much about it, but I think you're quite the expert. In our town, even Mr. Seol, the man downstairs, said I'm one of the best in the world."

Following the rare imitation, the blue hides its true identity!

Anyway, I didn't lie.

It was also true that a man with the surname Seol lived downstairs, and that if you stood in line all over the world, his name would come out soon.

“County? What kind of country town are you from…”

"Do you even realize I'm talking? Okay, why don't you just lie down and get up? You're going to have to give me my money."

Next, let's scratch gently!

If you look easy and then slowly scratch away, you will cross the line, and at that time, I am the Cheonhwageom, and here, Mo Yong-se has two sons and daughters who are trembling as well. You can just show him a big disgrace by saying, "What kind of unheard-of bastard is calling himself the son of Munju?"

The evil deeds of the Pyeonggoun are ninety-three points, barely hanging on to the edge of humanity, and the current situation itself is surprisingly trivial and petty, not a mortal sin that deserves immediate punishment from heaven and man.

So, pettiness is pettiness.

Moreover, he will be the one who made the situation worse by not being able to apologize immediately after overturning the table of the direct descendants of Cheonhwageom and Murong, so he will be severely criticized by the sect.

"I said I'd go with you out of consideration for you, Master. Why did you insist on going through all the trouble? Are you really trying to rip me off?"

“No, what is this…….”

Pyeonggoun mutters as if he is dumbfounded.

Then, Murong Juhee's eerie voice was heard again.

“What? What the heck? My Lady, should I kill you?”

"Hey, you can't get paid if you kill him. Excuse me, young master. Is there a bounty on his head? If the bounty is greater than the amount you're owed, you can cut off his head and take it to the authorities."

"How could such a thing exist? And even if it did, why would we talk about it here?"

“What, or is it not? Why are you yelling and all? Are you hurt by something?”

"no."

Suddenly, Pyeonggoun ground his teeth.

I opened my mouth again and said 'no', but the tip of the sword touched my Adam's apple and I gritted my teeth in fear.

"Come on, stand up, boys, let's go get our money. I finally bought some new clothes, and what a sight this is. So, Master, since I ruined a piece of clothing I've always cherished and cherished, you'll have to pay me double the price."

“……Didn’t you just say you bought new clothes? But they’re clothes you’ve always cherished? How can newly bought clothes become clothes you’ve always cherished?”

“Well, it’s because I really liked the clothes and it felt like something I’d always dreamed of?”

Then again, click click click.

I gently scratched the ground all the way to Cheongryongmun with Pyeonggoun in front.

Unfortunately, I couldn't get much of a reaction from Pyeonggoun, so I just kept my mouth shut while gritting my teeth.

Should I say this kid is secretly well-behaved, or should I say he has a thick mask?

Would a conman walk around with that name written all over his face? He had such a kindly face that it was easy to understand why the ronin fell for him.

However, the onlookers were entertained throughout.

Wasn't the composition of Qing's party itself interesting to begin with?

One tall woman and three short people.

The two smaller ones cover the face, one is the woman's womb and the other is the man's womb.

And the youngest boy still had his young face completely exposed, so the ones with their faces covered must have looked younger as well.

In summary, wasn't it exactly like the eldest sister leading her younger siblings out, or the mother leading her children out?

In that situation, there was a problem with the son of the head of the Cheongryongmun Gate, so how could I not follow him on the road to Cheongryongmun Gate?

So, with Pyeonggoun at the front, and Qing and the children following close behind, a crowd of onlookers gathered.

What's going on? Well, how did this happen? The number of onlookers gradually increases.

Traditionally, the crowd that fills the wide streets of the prosperous city of Dangsan County follows the group.

Of course, Qing knew this would happen.

Because the Zhongyuan people were a race that would loiter from afar and stick their heads out even in dangerous situations where there were fights between warriors in order to watch.

And if you're going to embarrass someone, the more people there are watching, the more embarrassing it will be.

Of course, from Pyeonggoun's perspective, the way home must have felt very long and far.

Or maybe it's the other way around.

If I had hoped to never reach you, the journey home might have felt so short and so short.

I can't know what's inside since I'm changing it so often.

However, from the perspective of the Cheongryongmun, it seems inevitable that an emergency will be declared at an untimely time.

Of course, wouldn't countless people be approaching from far away, filling the street in front of the school?

What if the disciple who was standing in front of the guard immediately ran to report the situation, and the one who was leading the way was our master who was in a state of death?

like that.

When I arrived in front of the Cheongryongmun Gate after walking for about half an hour, a group of disciples had already blocked the signboard.

The expression on Pyeonggoun's face as he watched that scene gradually became more and more rotten, and his gradually slowing footsteps must have represented his feelings.

Then, Qing started nagging behind him.

"What is it, Master? Are you tired already? A warrior is exhausted after walking halfway. What good is being so weak? Of course, he is indeed weak. I was just casually reaching out and was surprised when I was grabbed. I thought I was late, but you're just too slow."

Suddenly.

"Oh, did I offend you? I'm sorry again. I didn't realize it. I didn't mean anything bad, I was just telling the truth, but sometimes the truth can be painful."

Crackle.

"But there's a famous saying in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, right? Frustration makes a man grow. The frustration you feel about your own shortcomings, your slow progress in the art of enlightenment, will become the foundation for your growth. Oh, then you should thank me. Thank me quickly."

Kkaddeuddeuk!

"Oh my, your teeth are wearing down, your teeth are wearing down. Why do you use them so harshly at this age? They say chewing is one of the five blessings, but your later years won't be easy. You'll live a long and healthy life."

At this level, it would be brave not to draw your sword and rush in right away.

What a pity that such a rascal kept his mouth shut. Unfortunately, even if he concealed his power, it didn't seem like it would produce any more dramatic scenes.

And finally, in front of the main gate of Cheongryongmun.

As the disciples, drawn swordsmen, came out into the crowd and bowed their heads toward Pyeonggoun, it was the moment when the claim that he was the son of the lord was clearly revealed as fact.

Even without that, I was certain because there were quite a few people among the onlookers muttering in the guest room who recognized me.

In front of the Blue Dragon Clan members, Qing pats Pyeong-go-un on the shoulder.

“Now, young master, come out with my money.”

“……”

"If you're planning on stealing, you see those people behind you? If you don't take it, the whole city will be covered in rumors before dawn tomorrow, saying you're a worthless brat who ran off with the sect to steal some of the money you gave me."

“……”

With the final thud, Pyeonggoun slowly moves towards the main gate.

Then he suddenly shouts at the Aemun Blue Dragon Clan members.

“What are you guys doing!? Are you watching!? Everyone except the guards, get in!”

Oh, I said.

I thought I lost my voice again.

In that moment, Qing's heart softened.

First of all, seeing him suddenly lose his temper made me feel like all the time I had been nagging him and whining for the past half hour had been worth it, and I felt a sense of accomplishment that he had finally gotten his act together.

But there was another reason more important than that.

The evil karma of the Blue Dragon Clan members is quite good. What the heck, looking at that kid's actions, I thought he was some kind of den of evil.

In the end, it turns out that bastard was the only one.

So I guess we can leave it at that.

When he comes out with the money, I will visit him formally and meet with the Lord. I don't have any particular ill feelings towards him, but I will tell him that he needs to pay more attention to his children's character education.

As a gesture of friendship, I said I could sleep at Cheongryongmun today.

So, he waits with determination, determined to complete his revenge by repaying Qing's incompetence with his own incompetence.

… … while waiting.

What the heck? Why would it take so long to just get the money?

Or is this kid trying to make me wait on purpose because I'm going crazy?

but.

As time goes by, my money doesn't come.

In the end, Qing's expression finally rotted away.

No, this kid, is he really that good?
