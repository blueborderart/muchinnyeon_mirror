\chapter{Every Treasure Has a Sad Legend (10)}

The reason he had noticed the village in the first place was the smoke from cooking rice, so Qing thought that when he returned, the table would be set right away.

"My table!"

Qing shouts and throws the door wide open.

However, Tian Yuxue, who was lying on the floor, just looked up at Qing with a look of wonder as to what kind of woman she was.

No table?

Qing's expression becomes gloomy.

"They put out food and then came out to fight, and it all burned down."

The kitchen where Osanchu's younger brother was cooking was empty and there was nothing there.

So that rice was replaced with charcoal.

Always be mindful of your firepower.

"So, I'm rebuilding it, and, oh dear, I'm going back to the market. Is that little boy cooking rice, or was he out in the field, harvesting the unripe rice?"

"Hmm. I'll check."

So Qing rushed to the kitchen.

I found a real name that was just rolling around.

"Changming'er? What about food?"

"yet."

"Huh?"

Chen Changming slowly turns his head.

As Qing looks around, he finds two pots thrown in a corner.

One had a charred black color in it, and the other one, as soon as I opened it, I was like, huh? What was this?

Is it porridge? It's porridge, but if it's rice, what was the state of the rice grains? Is it solid or liquid?

The culprit who caused the strange transformation of the rice state shrinks his neck.

"I guess there was a lot of water……"

"Hmm. It wasn't just a little, it was completely flooded. Huh? Come to think of it, Changming doesn't know how to cook? Hasn't he ever done cooking duty?"

"That old man said he liked plain rice. I put some in, but it's different from our pot…"

Characteristics of people who can't cook.

If the pot was changed, the water level cannot be adjusted.

Before entering the Shinnyeomun, Chen Changming, who was sick and only received handouts, had no history of cooking.

Even if I try, it's not the priestess's rice duty or cooking duty, it's the rice duty where I just cook real rice.

The Shinnyeomun pot has water marks drawn with a knife for the amount of rice needed for cooking, and for the amount needed for the middle of the rice.

"Well, just porridge. No, I can't even call this porridge, but it's not like I can't eat it."

Qing wanders around the kitchen, looking for anything else, and in the kitchen pantry, he finds grass, dried fish, salted meat, etc., which he roughly gathers together, stir-fries, and puts away.

Rice? Porridge? Something in between. Add a little more water, bring to a boil again, pour in soy sauce, and crack a bunch of eggs—

"Jangmyeong, stir that. Don't stir it slowly, stir it with all your might."

"huh."

With that insignificant first-class power in his hands like a bracken fern, he stirred it and was reborn as egg porridge.

"Oh."

Chen Changming's eyes sparkle as he takes a bite.

"You're good at cooking. You could cook it yourself."

"Wouldn't it be a great loss to the martial arts world if a peerless master like me were to become a monk?"

"I don't think it'll be bad. If I, the owner, and my sister can live together, find some lodging, and open a small inn in the countryside…"

"I can't use it. That's a very ominous sound."

"……? What's ominous-"

"Oh, and what about cooking? Just making rice or something."

Actually, Qing doesn't know how to cook.

Since I know the taste well, I just know what kind of taste it will be if I just put it in roughly.

You can put out a plate that looks edible, but you can't even come close to making a proper meal.

"Then let's just open a restaurant-"

"Why does this keep happening? What's wrong with your life at the Shinnyeomun? Who's bullying you? No, you're not? You bully people, you bully them. You're not the one being bullied."

"Just thinking about it. It sounds fun. If a fight breaks out, you can knock them out and collect the repair costs. Oh, and if you set it up in front of the Shinnyeomun Gate, the privates might come down and play."

What the heck? The old woman was hiding her powers?

It certainly sounds like fun.

Then, when guys like Madu come, I feed them a lot of paralytic medicine and make them study medicine.

Well, if there are guys who come in seeking revenge later in front of the Shinnyeomun Gate, they can all come out and beat them up.

If a strong man comes, if you immediately shout "Master," won't he come flying over riding a sword?

So, at the dinner table, Qing brings up that topic.

After taking it out, I realized that this wasn't something I said because I hated the life of a priestess.

I thought it was just a noise made to make a fuss.

"Huh. Does that sound fun?"

"Don't you think it would be fun?"

"There are probably a few people who think they'll retire and live a quiet life as a guesthouse, but that's not an option. Do you think being bossed around by subordinates was easy?"

"Oh. The lower one? That's dangerous."

"I've tried everything and I'm just saying. Whether you're a merchant, a shopkeeper, or an innkeeper, you're all subordinates to those bastards. Do you think borrowing money from others was easy?"

Tian Yuxue (the thief) said.

"Hmm."

"Anyway, the food was surprisingly good. But this isn't porridge or rice. What was it?"

"Water control failed. Jangmyeong was a masterpiece."

"Well, as long as it tastes good, that's all that matters. Anyway, if you go in, you'll end up coming out later."

"Right. Would you like me to bring you some rice and water? Whatever you do, you'll get out the same."

"I'm getting older, so I can't digest raw rice. Eat it yourself. Aren't you old enough to chew steel?"

This was not something to say at the dinner table.

However, they are very strong-willed people who specialize in running wild in Cheonyuhak, Qing, and Yaji, so they don't really care.

Only Chen Changming, who had grown up preciously, quietly put down his spoon.

However, Qing sneakily glanced at Tian Yuxue's expression and then cautiously began to bring up the subject.

"Ah. But, Master, was it really necessary to only use the absorption magic, and to do it secretly?"

"then?"

"Looking at it, it seems like there's a world of people out there ready to kill. Why don't we just go around like we did this morning and kill all the sword-wielding thugs we come across?"

At that, Tian Yuxue sighed deeply.

"When I think about what happened just now, I can't help but feel like I wouldn't do something like that. But how? Would you kill someone, shatter someone's danjeon and banish them? Or would you just beat up someone less evil, lecture them, and send them away?"

"But we can't wait until they do something bad. We were a step too late just now, but what if we had come sooner? Would we have just spared those horrible bastards? Would they have reflected on their actions and become new people?"

"Hmm."

"If we must rid the world of all that's harmful, shouldn't we also quickly eliminate not just objects, but those who should not be alive? Those evil creatures who cannot be saved—"

"Stop. I understand what you mean."

Tian Yuxue sighs deeply again.

"Then where was the standard? If we don't know how evil he was, how he lived, and what his story was, how can we know whether he deserved to die or not?"

"But. Even though they knew there was a magician who could absorb the essence, wouldn't all of those gathered be the same guy?"

"That's right. Come to think of it, you've never had a particularly strong desire for martial arts. If everyone in the world were like you, I don't know, but when it comes to the Divine Sword, even a desire you didn't have before was awakened. Do you think I'm just telling you to get rid of it for no reason?"

I can't understand it because I'm a Qing who doesn't regret martial arts.

Likewise, the precious children of the martial arts world, those who have already been promised divine powers that are the envy of their clans or schools, will also not be able to understand.

But how many disciples of the famous monk Mujong, the ten great monks of the Gupailbang, and even the Sapa, are there in the world?

For most martial artists, divine skills are always a treasure floating higher than the clouds in the sky, and any martial artist imagines divine skills several times a day, thirsting for stronger, more precious, and more mysterious martial skills.

So, it's a magic absorption technique?

It doesn't really matter how evil or dangerous it's.

What's important was that it's a powerful martial art that's famous throughout the world, and that I have the opportunity to hold this divine art in my hands that I've only dreamed of.

A terrible side effect of the magic of absorption?

For those who lived on the pedestal of the martial arts world with third-rate or second-rate martial arts skills, or as outsiders outside the mainstream, such side effects were not even a consideration.

There was no basis or reason, but I think I can overcome the side effects.

It's a human problem, not an unmanned problem.

Who would go to a casino to lose money?

All gamblers have a certain good feeling that makes them want to take action.

I think today will be a great day.

I feel like I'm going to set a new casino record today.

If I just catch the pattern, I will catch three and eight and become a millionaire who wins every battle.

The same goes for the absorption magic.

Once you get used to it, are there any side effects?

If too much semen builds up and causes mental problems, you should be careful and suck as little as possible.

You're going to become a martial arts master?

Wouldn't it be better to live while hiding your true abilities?

Absorption magic only makes up for the lack of internal energy, so how would you know if you used other martial arts?

Then, when you become a peerless master like Hyeon-gyeong, no one in the world will be able to touch you.

"This was what it means to be a treasure. Even those who live ordinary lives, swinging their swords, are seduced by its magic and drawn to it. So, remember this. You must remember it."

It was Divine Thief's request to his successor.

The Divine Thiefs aren't just working in return for the martial arts I've received.

Because I understand that treasures can cause chaos and bloodshed in the world, I fulfill my duty as a divine being.

Qing, who has always been careless, nods her head without realizing it at the serious attitude displayed by Tian Yuxue.

This was probably why Tian Yuxue continues to maintain his blue numbers, even though he has been a corrupt merchant or a fake medicine peddler for fun and has lost a lot of good deeds.

"Yes, then do you now realize how shameful your words are? All those who aim for the Absorbing Magic are like that, so let's kill them all?"

"Hehe. Well, what about those famous Maduras whose names are already known? Wouldn't it be better to get rid of them? If we leave them alone, there's a chance they'll get the upper hand."

"Hmm. If they're already notorious, then they're definitely better off not existing in the world…"

"I'm not saying you have to hunt them down and kill them. Instead of hiding and searching for treasure, you can just wander around openly, chase away the odd ones, and get rid of the evil ones."

"Hmm."

"Anyone who somehow learned the geography would have already established themselves in a suspicious place. If we keep searching like this, won't we end up in the hands of someone dangerous?"

Tian Yuxue stirs the egg porridge in the bowl.

After doing that for a while, I sighed deeply.

"You're right. You mentioned the gambling den, right? That was me. I thought I could just find the secret and burn it as soon as I entered Mount Lao. But now I see it was nothing more than a baseless presumption. If someone were to intercept the secret, if they were to secretly seek it out, that cursed monster, the soul-sucking demon, would be born."

And then mutter.

Hell without income, hell without income.

These are the words of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva: If I don't go to hell, who will?

Surprisingly, Qingdo knows this too!

Because this was the spirit of Shaolin monks and the preface to the Buddhist scriptures that trace their roots back to the past.

Saying that he will guide the wicked and save sentient beings.

If Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva knew, it would be difficult to endure the club, and even Bodhisattva Bae could not endure it and opened the world of death, but it ended up being interpreted as a horse.

It was originally a phrase from the Ksitigarbha Sutra, and it's the great devotion of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva to save even the wicked.

It's so outrageous that he ended up saying that he would kill the wicked and go to hell too.

But Shaolin Temple was a pseudo-temple from the beginning.

It was nothing more than a martial arts school in the form of a Buddhist school, and martial arts are fundamentally skills that harm others.

Even so, how great was the ambition to strike down evildoers for the world rather than say, 'I will live for myself!' with the world's most powerful martial arts?

And Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva may be able to save everyone.

Because humans are just small creatures that are too weak to even protect the innocent.

Qing laughs without saying a word.

The art of eliminating competitors.

Make them humble and look down on themselves.

The achievements of a fool are often disguised as coincidences, and do not cause anyone to be alarmed.

The art of negotiation and persuasion.

Make an offer that's absolutely unacceptable.

Only when the other person resists, then offer a realistic alternative.
