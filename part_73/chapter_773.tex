\chapter{Lineage (7)}

'The palace physician is visiting, so it would be best for you to remain in bed from morning.'

That was the subtle hint from Court Lady Jo.

Of course, Court Lady Jo's hints would also likely be the Empress's.

Cheong was a little worried about this.

Hmm. If you're a doctor, I wonder if feigning illness would work.

Of course. A doctor at the Forbidden City must be a fairly renowned doctor, right?

The eunuch who calls himself "Byeong-eo-ma-gak" isn't a medical professional, but a warrior. He managed to trick the doctor by filling his dantian with yin and yang.

Would that work on a proper doctor, especially someone who can read the pulse of the Forbidden City?

Amidst this slight anxiety, the doctor enters the main bedroom of Hambok Palace.

I thought the long cotton draped across the bed was a screen (it was, in fact, a screen). It appears the nobleman has blocked it so he can't peek at the man from his maternal home.

He can only extend his arm to take her pulse, obscured by the screen.

"Hmm."

``How was it?''

``You were in very good health, but……''

As expected, the palace physician's pulse was like this.

My heart was beating well, my breathing was strong and I am not trembling, and other than my hands being unusually cold, there was nothing unusual about me.

He was a very brave man.

"Aren't hands, after all, connected to the blood vessels of the entire body, a marker of health that reaches all the way to the internal organs? Isn't it because the danjeon was filled with cold energy, and even now, it's difficult to suppress, that my hands were cold?"

Qing quietly makes a claim.

The medical book says that the hands were connected to the whole body, so if you massage them and stimulate them, the whole body will become healthy.

Qing looked at the medical book and memorized it, but it was something she absolutely couldn't understand.

When emphasizing clapping or hand massage, wouldn't it be argued that the hands were the panacea and a collection of acupuncture points throughout the body, and when emphasizing walking or foot massage, wouldn't it be argued that the feet were the panacea and a collection of acupuncture points throughout the body?

Besides, shouldn't the hands be connected to the blood vessels of the entire body?

If it doesn't connect, it's just a severed hand.

Except for fingernails and hair, all body parts were connected to each other and share blood.

But now was not the time to satisfy your curiosity about medicine.

He was trying to argue that it was normal for his hands to be this cold, that his danjeon was frozen to death by the poison of the White Hand Witch, and that that was why they were so cold.

``Um, can I feel your pulse?''

``Oh, yes.''

Well, you were someone who knows how to manipulate energy.

Qing leads the extreme yin energy of the Bingbaek Shingong and blocks the area around the dantian.

At the same time, I would like it to look like the state where the Yang energy of the Juyangsesimgyeong was loosened, the extreme cold energy swirls around the dantian, and the three meridians were filled with Yang energy.

I can't guarantee anything since there was no unmanned treatment process in the medical classes and training of Langzhongdaein, but it was a result of careful planning.

And the result.

"Wow, your energy pulse was so strong. In my sixty years of experience, I've never felt such a healthy pulse. Hmm, it seems like there's a large worm in the gallbladder. Maybe you should blow some cigarette smoke on it later."

Intestinal worms, and the prescription of blowing tobacco smoke through the anus, were primitive and barbaric parasite remedies in ancient China.

By the way, it was said that the bottle that ate everything after breaking through the gochi and cleaning up did not change at all.

Well, Qing only knows the general shape by feeling it out.

The salamander was a parasitic salamander with two stripes on its body, so even if it had three stripes, there would have been no way to know the color.

Anyway, Qing was half impressed and half hurt.

Wow, you caught Mac and even caught the bottle of alcohol.

He was the elder who had decided to give up his position as the highest council member of the royal palace, and his name was so famous that there was no other person like him.

After all, experts can't be fooled.

"Uh, that? Hwalshindan? The elixir's properties were backfiring, so that's why. Yes, I think that's why. My lower abdomen was a mess. It would be great if you could take a look and prescribe a treatment, but even I can only manage to keep it in check."

``It’s definitely a situation where the cold air was so strong that it’s difficult to feel the pulse of the dantian and vital energy, but, um, it doesn’t seem to be a particularly harmful energy…''

Then how?

I guess I have to persuade them somehow.

"I know my body well. I'm sure you don't know how terrifying the Soju Witch's Soju Poison is, but Soju Poison was a terrifying infiltration that swirls around fiercely, freezing the blood vessels throughout the body before shattering them and threatening even expeditions. It's the nightmare of every warrior."

I know my body well!

And what do you know about doctors!?

It was the natural order of the world that the owner of anything knows better than others, so isn't it true that the patient knows his or her condition best?

Besides, do you know the martial arts world and martial arts?

``Ahem, I don’t know much about martial arts, but Ma’am, it’s not that fierce or violent, was it?''

``If we neutralize it with the elixir’s energy, wouldn’t the cold air outside become docile as well?''

``Hmm, does that make sense? It won’t work……''

The palace doctor trailed off.

Qing adds one more word to that.

``And I’m embarrassed to tell you, sir, but I have some medical training, so I know how to take care of my body, so my prognosis may be good.''

There was a furrow between his eyebrows.

Didn't you say that he was a famous master at a very young age?

Since he learned medicine in a time when he didn't even have enough time to master martial arts, he couldn't help but feel a little bad.

The original lawmakers were also sensitive to this.

A quack has a way of catching people.

Aren't the people who haven't properly learned the lawmakers' complaints the ones who were catching people and ruining the reputation of the lawmakers?

``You say you studied medicine? By any chance, may I ask what medical books you’ve read?''

What did you read to say you learned medicine?

If you had seen the expression on Rep. Qing's face, you would have thought, "Oh, he must be a little upset," but the appearance of the Rep. was only external, with two layers of cotton and mosquito netting.

So Qing answered obediently.

``First, I memorized the Huangdi Neijing’s Yeonga compilation version, and also the Jinwonpil version of the Zhutakshi Sui Jing, and the Jade Medicine section of the Jeo Nae Yak Seong Chong Jin Yak. Oh, and also the Jeong I Yeon Gam, and also…''

Since a doctor who could recite the medical books that the Langzhongdae people had been forced to memorize was visiting, it would be best for him to remain in bed from the morning. This was the hint given by Lady Cho.

Of course, the advice of the court lady will soon be the advice of the Empress Dowager.

He was a little worried about Qing.

Well, if you're a member of the National Assembly, maybe pretending to be sick will work.

That would be the case, since a member of the Geumseong branch would be a fairly well-known name.

The eunuch who said that he was sick was not a medical professional, but a commoner. He filled his danjeon with negative energy and somehow managed to fool him.

Would that work for a proper member of parliament, and even for someone who can read the pulse of the financial world?

In that slightly anxious state, the member of parliament enters the bedroom of the main building of Hambok Palace.

I thought the long cotton linen hanging over the bed was a mosquito net (it was a mosquito net), but it seems like it was hidden so that the nobleman could not look at the man from his maternal grandparents.

It's like stretching out your arm beyond the point where even the pulse was obscured.

``Ugh.''

``How was it?''

``You were in very good health, but……''

As expected, the palace physician's pulse was like this.

My heart was beating well, my breathing was strong and I am not trembling, and other than my hands being unusually cold, there was nothing unusual about me.

He was a very brave man.

Langzhongdaein recites the medical book he was forced to memorize.

Of course, Langzhongdaein was testing the reckless woman to see if she had read the book properly after only a few days, and when he saw that she had actually memorized it, he just rammed it into her head.

The palace and Gang-Yong were impressed by the list.

I thought it was a fake after reading a few lines of the book, but if the doctor heard it, anyone would know that it was a list of books carefully selected by a proper teacher.

The more I listen, the more impressed I become.

If you want to quickly get a medical student started and use it, you can read it like this list.

``Oh. Do you have a teacher?''

"Not to the point of being a master, but did you briefly intervene with the Langzhongdaein? Still, you said that as a female doctor, I can roughly do the job of a human being."

"Oh, you've been trained by the great master Langzhong? Indeed, I wondered how you could remain so healthy even when you were sick. The root cause of all illness was habit, so those who practice medicine live long lives."

For people in the middle class, connections were a treasure trove.

The word "Jeongabodo" means a famous sword that must be passed down from generation to generation, and it means a universal solution that works anywhere and an omnipotent authority.

In other words, there was no solution that worked as well for the people of the Zhongyuan as personal connections.

And who was Langzhongdaein?

He was one of the most respected members of the National Assembly.

Despite his excellent medical skills, he had the humility to call himself a quack, and his dedication to only visiting dangerous and remote places to care for underprivileged patients, even saying that he would not charge for pulse diagnosis because he was a quack.

Did you get recognized by such a great person?

I don't know about her skills, but her spirit meant that she was a doctor who devotedly cared for underprivileged patients with all her heart.

and.

Would such a woman really feign illness?

Suddenly, Mama's trust level skyrockets.

It must be a very dire situation, as he must be saying that he doesn't have much time left to live.

``Mama, since you said that the Sun Life Supplement was helpful, I will prescribe it for you for now.''

Qing's eyes widen.

If you fake an illness, the elixir will come back to you?

And then, suddenly, it feels like the line between kindness and complacency has suddenly widened like the ocean.

then?

A smile appears on Qing's lips.

"Uh, was that medicine possibly coming from the palace's resources? How dare a girl take it privately for her own personal gain…"

"Your concern for the nation's treasury was truly admirable, Your Majesty. But aren't you the young hero whom the Emperor himself wished to congratulate? Furthermore, your body will become even more precious in the future. Please refrain from such remarks and focus solely on recovering your health."

His eyes sparkled with laughter.

Well, the elixir was good. It's just what I needed.

Originally, Qing had no desire for elixir.

Even now, my internal energy was overflowing.

But will this continue to be the case in the future?

Due to the nature of the current dantian, the internal energy of a future martial artist may be insufficient. Who am I? The Transcendent Flower Sword of Heaven.

Even if I were to reach the realm of reality, I would have to surpass it in terms of my internal energy. I could not dare to suffer the humiliation of standing shoulder to shoulder with an ordinary realm of reality.

so.

"I've already taken one Sunflower Seed, barely able to suppress my stomach and achieve some stability. To show my strength, I'll need to take a stronger potion all at once. So, maybe three…?"

"That's right. If you take the same elixir, you'll adapt to its potency and its effects will diminish, so you should take it to that extent to see any improvement. If there's a powerful elixir that can replace the Taeyang Hwalshindan, I'll send it to you as a replacement."

He was a thief of elixirs, following the thief of martial arts.

This was none other than theft against the financial institution.

If Cheon Yu-hak had known, he would have been so happy that Qing would have seen a gigantic smiling face reflected high in the sky.\footnote{'Big Enough' meme}

How many thieves have there been under heaven who have broken into the Forbidden City? They were truly divine, divine!

I saw a really bad thief.

And in addition to the elixir.

"Also, I'll need to prescribe some herbal medicine to help my body, but this is my first time experiencing White Hand Resentment Poison. What herbs would be helpful?"

She didn't even need a decoction.

The herbal medicine was tasteless, and drinkng it wouldn't make her any healthier.

\textit{Well, I should offer the herbal medicine to the Empress.}

\textit{She must have been in serious health issue since she had collapsed. Let's see, what kind of herbal medicine is good for congestion?}

\begin{center}
	$\ast$~$\ast$~$\ast$
\end{center}

The health of the young hero Seo Moon Qing was in critical condition!

It's the aftereffects of the injuries sustained in the final battle with the White Hand Witch!

Even the pulse diagnosis was given by the palace elders!

The elder of the palace, the second bravest doctor in the world, the Cheonha Jei!

The palace doctor was a person who had completely distanced himself from politics in the palace, so he did not particularly hide the results of his pulse reading.

Above all, aren't all the women who make herbal medicines palace maids experts in spreading and hearing rumors?

"They put in all kinds of precious herbs. How long do you think you'll live by brewing it so thickly? Oh, they said you'd be the crown princess, but you're in good health."

``Hey, don’t you know?''

"what?"

"Shh. I'm telling you this only, but the palace physician said the Cheonhwa Sword might not live long. That's why I'm brewing this precious herbal medicine. I told you this, so keep it a secret, right? (Just keep it a secret that I told you this.)"

``Well then. I’m a tight-lipped person. (Don’t worry, I’ll just hide the fact that you said it.)''

A herbal medicine made through a process where information leaks out like that, a herbal medicine made by boiling all kinds of good medicinal ingredients together, which makes it a very precious health tonic rather than a regular herbal medicine.

The empress who received the herbal medicine was satisfied.

``Ah, that’s good. Even though the prince was grown, he doesn’t know how to take care of his own mother, yet how can my daughter do such pretty things?''

"lol……."

Qing smiled awkwardly.

It's just a side job, but if you like it this much,

Miss, I am not your daughter, and I will not be, I have to tell you… …

But for the Empress, the preciousness of the tonic was not important.

Even when it was difficult to deceive the court physician about his health after he collapsed, isn't it so admirable and sweet that he took the time to think of his mother?

So, the empress was someone who could easily swallow bitter medicine as if it were sweet water.

And thanks to this, even more ominous rumors began to swirl in the palace.

The Empress steals Heavenly Blossom Sword's herbal medicine!

Not only does he call a terminally ill woman every night and beat her with a whip, he now takes away her medicine and makes her drink it all up!

"Your Majesty, please, please keep your dignity. What kind of bizarre situation was this? The wedding hasn't even begun, and already the court ladies were whispering that their daughter-in-law was about to be killed?"

The emperor's tone was almost pleading.

But the Empress snorted.

"Daughter-in-law? Daughter-in-law? Your Majesty, speak properly. How can you say such things when there was no future for our marriage?"

"Please. How could I not know how worried I am about the Crown Prince? But listen, Your Majesty. I swear by the gods of heaven and earth that I will never let the Crown Prince touch that rascal of the martial arts world. I will lock him away in a corner, where he will never be touched, let alone seen. So, Your Majesty, there was no need to worry so much about the Crown Prince!"

The Empress's ears perked up.

Well, it's a little bit exciting.

You want me to be locked up in a secluded palace in the Forbidden City for the rest of my life?

Then, wouldn't I be able to live with you in my arms until I die?

A princess was destined to one day marry into a distant land, and that was her duty and the meaning of her existence.

But if I can keep you by my side and not send you away, if nothing untoward happens, if I can feed you good food, dress you in nice clothes, and hold you in my arms for the rest of my life, then that would be great.

The Emperor, noticing the Empress's indifference, then explains his intentions.

She was a lady in name only, but in reality, she was trying to steal and destroy the divine dragon of the martial arts world.

Even that ruthless, unstoppable Emperor was only a peak warrior at that age. Do you know what level that prostitute was at now? It's true that the rumors of Hwagyeong and the rascals of the martial arts world claiming she'll be the greatest in the future were true!

The height of the Hwagyeong was so high that even the window guards were surprised and almost revealed their presence.

"What? You're bringing such a dangerous woman into the palace? And as the crown princess at that? Your Majesty! What on earth were you saying!?"

But the Empress keeps shouting.

My daughter, my precious daughter who was lost and found again.

I wish I could hold you in my arms for the rest of my life, but how could that be for you? It's all just a mother's greed, so it can't be.

``Empress. Please.''

The emperor pounded his chest in frustration.

Isn't the empress the emperor's first consort and also his greatest political ally?

Until now, I have always supported whatever the Emperor wanted to do, and I have never once opposed it so strongly.

"Your Majesty, I will not stand by and watch that woman paired with the Crown Prince even if it means getting dirt in my eyes. Know that."

After saying that, the empress just walks away.

The emperor then rubbed his forehead.

Then, wouldn't a human figure suddenly appear on the wall?

The Emperor's secret bodyguard, the title of the Emperor's guard, the Spear Guard.

"Your Majesty, your empress was so strongly opposed. Wouldn't it be better to consider another approach? If you wish to avoid future trouble, please say just one word to your subordinates."

The emperor then reveals his white teeth.

"No, no. It's better. Rather than taking that Heavenly Blossom Sword woman and leaving her in a nice place, wouldn't it be better for the martial arts world to see her suffer a miserable life of humiliation and disgrace? Even if she's a dragon or something, if she's hated, she'll end up in such a miserable state. Well, I guess it's better to say it's better since the empress was so disgusted."

The emperor gritted his teeth.

The eyes that flicker in accordance with that.

"Go and tell the eunuch Jang to gather his officials. I haven't been able to convey my true feelings due to pride, but now that it's come to this, I must properly convey the truth and ask for their understanding. They will understand if they know I don't intend to make Heavenly Blossom Sword a faction of the Heavenly King."
