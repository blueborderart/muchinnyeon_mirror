\chapter{Convalescence (12)}

When Ximen Surin thought, 'Oh no', the incident had already happened.

Now, my disciple Hwagyeong's resilience was not ordinary, so when I punch him, a sharp pain rises up at the same time-

"Arggghh!"

An indescribable scream erupts.

Ximen Surin, where on earth did this child go wrong?

It was said that at first she was elegant and cautious, but gradually she acquired the dignity of a noble lady.

But now?

Even screaming can be a bit more beautiful and elegant, like 'Ah…'

Even the disciple's screams were frivolous. What the heck.

Qing grabs her head and falls down.

It was a truly gruesome sight that would make anyone ask if he was truly an enemy rather than a teacher.

A grown disciple was lying naked in the body of a woman.

Knees pulled in tightly, shoulders hunched, the sight of someone trembling and shaking like a bug.

"Ahem. Well, let's leave the joke at that."

Ximen Surin was a little embarrassed.

What the heck? was it really this painful?

Thought was the act of adapting the world's laws to one's own. That's why people fall like meteors, why a blade passes over space and then claws at it again, and why even the weight felt by men and women when hit by the same honey chestnut changes.

So, Ximen Surin's nuclear honey chestnut was actually a male-only nuclear fusion, and it has a sweet side that varies in power depending on gender.

But what Qing feels is, gasp.

When you're in so much pain, you just don't think about anything.

In extreme pain, instinct automatically assumes the most natural posture, so you can only curl up and tremble like a baby in the womb.

After wandering in that pain of selflessness for a long time, the thought that came to me as soon as I came to my senses.

Oh, this really hurt like crazy.

Somehow, my head was fine, but it kept hurting.

No, Master, no matter what, where on earth was there a master who beats his disciple with his thoughts?

Even this overlap, why does one nuclear blow cause two types of pain, a stinging sensation that feels like it's being split apart?

If thoughts divide men and women, the world will judge them. What was this strange thing?

It's ambiguous, so let's just count them both. I'll give you both.

I didn't realize it when it was at its peak, but after reaching the top, I realized how miraculous this move was.

And if you know and get it right, it actually hurts more.

"Is this the way it's going to be lying now?"

Ximen Surin's eyebrows twitched.

Why was this so funny?

The elegant dignity of a female master was a piece of cake.

At some point, a child of six or seven years old started acting cute and flirtatious in front of me, and I couldn't tell if she was my disciple or my daughter, and even my daughter couldn't act so shamelessly.

"I, really, ugh, really hurts so much……."

"Haa…, come here."

Ximen Surin sighed deeply and called her disciple.

Then, the disciple crawled into her arms.

\textit{If I keep accepting it like this, my disciple will inevitably become more spoiled.}

But when Ximen Surin saw this wanton woman, her anger subsided on its own and pity slowly rose, and her heart melted with a warm feeling.

As Ximen Surin gently stroked her disciple's long hair, she didn't know whether she was raising her disciple or a child, but the corners of her mouth were loose and curved slightly without her knowing it.

"No, even the teardrops were hanging. Why on earth was this so cruel? What kind of a person would cry in pain? I've never heard of a disciple sobbing and fighting."

"It really hurts…"

"Hey. This."

He must have just been upset because he got hit by his master.

Was it too harsh on that girl who just says whatever comes to mind? No, it was harsh. She always starts off by dropping the nuke first and then apologizes.

"Master, can I leave a scar?"

"You still haven't come to your senses."

"But scars are cool…"

"Haa. Do as you wish."

Ximen Surin finally sighed.

From the perspective of an old woman, this was a choice that the disciple will definitely regret later.

I should have erased it when I could have.

Old scars cannot be erased even with Jechangsan Mountain, so the only way was to undergo a complete transformation or climb Hyeon-gyeong to reverse the course of the body and remove the scars to allow new flesh to grow.

But he said he wanted it this way.

If you regret it later, you may become wiser by reflecting on your present recklessness, or it may become a worldly driving force that requires you to enter the present.

So, Qing was granted a scar!

It was a great achievement that was barely achieved at the cost of a splitting headache.

However, Qing underestimated my body too much.

Although Qing refused to go to Jechangsan, saying that he would ask his master and decide whether to leave a scar or not, this was an action that made him look down on the evil woman of Sacheon, Tang Lan-Ah'a.

Not even noticing the evil of ignoring the words of his best friend, Tangnan-ah was secretly trying to take medicine in the middle of the night when he suddenly thought, why was the scar getting thinner and thinner? If I leave it alone, it will disappear.

Although it was not common, this type of constitution does exist.

Just in case, Tang Lan-ah concluded that if left alone after a thorough check during the trip, it would disappear.

So I just pretended to give up.

That is, the scar will disappear.

Qing got hit for no reason.

But Qing doesn't know. As always.

"You bitch, it's time to step aside."

"Can't you stay like this a little longer? It still hurts. was it, uh, something wrong?"

Ximen Surin paused. It was indeed convex.

"What the hell was this? Can't you at least get dressed? Even if that's not the case, what's wrong with a grown woman like you? I'm afraid someone might see you."

"Hey, it's embarrassing now. After all, they're my disciples, so it's not like everyone hasn't seen them. Hehe."

Ximen Surin paused again.

Now I see that it was all my fault that this girl lost all sense of shame.

By walking around with that messy body exposed, you gain self-defense and lose your sense of shame.

If I had known that I would end up like this in Hwagyeong, I would have just left it as is. My greed was excessive and I ended up creating a huge disaster.

Strictly speaking, there was no need for Ximen Surin to blame himself.

If not, Qing would have already passed away in the other world, and this scar wouldn't have been a scar at all, but rather a diagonal cut, and he would have gone to the other side of death, not knowing whether it was the end, a return, or the beginning of this episode.

In the end, Ximen Surin, unable to kick out his disciple with a displeased expression, simply patted his head.

Because originally, you had to accept complaints to learn.

Shandong Province, Jiaozhou County. Shandong Provincial Commander-in-Chief.

The Dojihwisasa was the largest military facility in Zhongyuan, with a thousand soldiers stationed in all four directions and another thousand in the center, for a total of five thousand soldiers.

And then, in the dead of night, a suspicious man dressed in pitch black crosses the Dojihwisa Temple.

In Zhongyuan, it was called a nightgown, a functional garment worn to avoid being caught while walking around at night.

It was also the most popular costume among thieves, assassins, robbers, and rapists, making it an absolutely unwelcome guest to encounter in the middle of the night.

As it was a military camp with a thousand men, the patrols were strict and there were no gaps, but the man in black skillfully follows the shadow of the moon and sneaks in.

So, if you kill the path of the black man, the outline of the destination will be roughly revealed.

The largest mansion, the residence and office of the Commander-in-Chief, the owner of the Commander-in-Chief's residence.

So the man in black secretly climbs up the high wall of the mansion, moves across the roof, and then slowly digs into the interior of the mansion.

Drum, rumb.

On the huge bed, loud snoring.

It was the loud roar of the Shandong Provincial Commander, Wang Shuanglong.

The man in black stands quietly by the bedside and looks down, but Wang Ssangryong was unaware of it and just wanders around in dreamland for a while.

The man in black quietly draws his knife.

The blade, painted black to kill its luster, was sharp even in the midst of pitch black.

And so, the male and female blades quietly dug under the chin of the twin dragons.

"Cough."

"Shhh."

The man in black puts a finger in front of his lips.

Wang Ssangryong, who suddenly woke up from a cold moment pressing down on his neck, trembled violently and expressed his agreement.

"Shandong Provincial Commander, Wang Shuanglong. Is that right?"

"That, that's right. I don't know what you want, but no, I'll give you double, no, triple. So put this knife away and-"

Then the sword really retreats.

"I apologize for the inconvenience."

Wang Ssangryong was momentarily flustered.

Just saying, what kind of assassin would offer you more money and you'd back off and be so polite?

But that was only for a moment, as Wang Ssangryong quickly realized his misunderstanding.

"I am an admiral of the same class, and I have the honor of serving Her Majesty the Empress. Please forgive me for coming in secret, as the world was watching."

Wang Ssangryong's head was spinning.

If you were a fellow admiral, aren't you a great lord?

Although the rank was lower in national law, his power cannot be measured by rank, so isn't he a big shot who can be blown away even by a commander?

Why does your Majesty use honorifics?

Wang Ssangryong sneaks a peek.

"Oh, ahem. Are you the lord?"

"Since the law of the land dictates ranks, shouldn't I become one of its servants? Please speak humbly."

Wang Ssangryong's expression was hazy.

"Ahem. The military was a special place, so how can we judge rank? How could I commit such an offense, My Lord?"

That doesn't mean he was really using informal tones.

Pride was a bad strategy that creates useless enemies, so why should you treat them badly and hurt their feelings?

"Lord General will soon be held accountable at the Imperial Palace. This is to punish you for the grave crime of privately mobilizing your troops for the sake of a single Wulin person. By taking your troops at a crucial time for the farming season, you have caused great harm to the nation. This disloyalty will be widely publicized and severely punished."

"A sinner should have no excuse. Since I have committed disloyalty as a soldier, I will accept your judgment with utmost sincerity."

There was a smile on Wang Ssangryong's face as he spoke.

Why? Is Wang Shuanglong a masochist who dreamt of self-destruction?

"However, in my view, that martial artist was a benefactor who had saved his son's life, and the Lord General simply wanted to repay the price of his son's life as a parent, and since he could not abandon this heavenly karma, I think he should be relieved of his official position and allowed to return to the mountains and rivers in consideration of his past services."

"Hmm. I guess that's how it ends up."

"But isn't Lord General's son not only exceptional in his timeliness but also in his filial piety? Last night, I had a dream in which your son, perhaps willingly, submitted a petition, pleading that he would atone for his father's sins with his life. Heaven was moved by this, and perhaps, to atone for his father's sins, he was given the punishment by having him shouldering his father's duty."

"That was a very strange dream."

"So, don't worry too much. Lord General, your loyalty has already been recognized and you have been granted the retirement. You will be called upon to command your troops at any time. I heard that the commander of Hubei Province, Yeong-gang, was already in advanced stages of old age. Heaven must be deeply concerned. Aren't talented individuals capable of commanding an army of ten thousand men rare and precious?"

"Oh my. I hope he would get better soon."

Wang Ssangryong's expression was full of smiles.

Isn't this what the Eastern Depot emissary essentialy said?

'You step down, and your son will be the new general.'

'If you wait quietly, the Palace will assign you to another post, so just rest easy and enjoy your vacation.'

\textit{As expected, meeting Madam was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! I had a great dream last night!}

Wang Ssangryong himself was the city commander and the city commander. In the end, he was the same.

But, what about his son's position?

That's right, the general was being copied!

Our family was a double-decker bus, the military was strong, and our mother was a newcomer!

\textit{This was the grace that the Madam gave me in serving her, and the reason why I became a loyal subject only after coming to her.}

\textit{Tonight too, grace was sweeping across the night sky.}

\textit{This Wang Ssangryong sill serve with all my life.}

It was the moment when Wang Ssangryong's loyalty exploded.
